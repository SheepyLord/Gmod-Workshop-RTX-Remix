R26 adds `0041-Atmosphere-the-sky-without-a-horizon.patch`
([ADR 0139](../docs/decisions/0139-the-sky-without-a-horizon.md)): `rtx.atmosphere.noHorizon` (bool,
default False), for maps that float in the sky or in space. A view direction below the horizon gets
the sky instead of the ground-level haze the planet's sky gave it:

- **the air's gradient** of its mirror above (`noHorizonMirror` in `atmosphere_common.slangh`): the
  sky-view LUT's bake marches the mirror's air into the LUT's lower half, with the true direction's
  angle to the sun and moons for the phase terms (`evalAtmosphereRadiance`'s new `phaseDir`), so the
  sun's aureole stays around the sun;
- **the clouds and the high layer** of its antipode (`noHorizonCloudDir`): the screen-space cloud pass
  marches `-dir` for a pixel below the horizon (`marchCloudLayers`' new `phaseDirYUp` keeps the true
  direction for the clouds' phase), the high layer meets the antipode's shell, and secondary rays read
  the antipode's texel of the dome LUT. A mirror of the clouds read as a lake's reflection. Within
  0.0015 of the horizon the cloud ray is held just above it, so no line of bare sky is left. The
  cloud bleed fades out over the first 6 degrees below (a dome texel's silver lining belongs to its own
  direction);
- **what lies beyond the air** where it is: the stars and the night sky image without the horizon's
  fade (the airglow's boost toward the horizon is its mirror's), the moons and their glow lit through
  the air of their mirror. The sun disc keeps the time of day: below the horizon it is night.

`AtmosphereArgs::noHorizon` takes the former `r18Pad0` slot (the buffer keeps its size); it stays in the
sky-view LUT's key, and the transmittance/multiscattering and voxel-grid keys zero it. Off, every site
computes what it did before. The dev menu's No Horizon (Atmosphere) shows the option's description;
both are translated in the six catalogs, and `RtxOptions.md` is regenerated.

Built in `out/worktrees/r17/out/runtime-src` on 0040 (`3cb32fb8`) as `17dcc86c` (branch
`claude/r26-sky`), exported alone (`format-patch -1 --start-number 41`), then built and imported by
`build_runtime.ps1` (the tree checked against the base and the 37 patches, both compile passes):
`d3d9.dll` 418,258,944 bytes, SHA-256 `35ce500857c852e7babf0bd5a6fdc9495eef39703cfb2d4c33547c0bcec33054`,
build identity `remix-main+17dcc86c`; 61,618,824 bytes xz in Git LFS. No texture, buffer or new pass;
the DLL grows by 0.7 MB of shader code. PoC checks in [TESTING.md](../docs/TESTING.md) ("R26").

R20-E adds `0040-Publish-live-upscaling-state-for-startup-advice.patch`
([ADR 0123](../docs/decisions/0123-live-upscaling-readback.md)). The selected device publishes one
versioned atomic snapshot at `rtx.runtime.upscalingState`, through the existing
`remixapi_GetGameValue`; plugins cannot write the reserved `rtx.runtime.` namespace. Readiness waits
for startup graphics/DLSS presets and pending callbacks, is invalidated by dependent option edits and refreshed
at each present. The fixes' `RemixConfig.GetUpscalingState()` reads it for R20-B's startup hint.
Unit test: `test_upscaling_state` (also compiled from the patch by the aggregate Release gate).

**0040 is not yet in the imported `d3d9.dll`.** Its exact hash is in `base.json`'s `pending_patches`,
separately from unchanged packaged provenance. Integration imports one DLL with every reviewed R20
runtime patch; `build_runtime.ps1` clears the pending record on import. The guard accepts only
declared new suffix patches, never changes to packaged inputs. Pending patches still participate in
every source-tree/build check.
R20-D adds patches 0034 and 0035 ([report](../docs/handover/R20-D-report.md),
[ADR 0121](../docs/decisions/0121-source-effect-categories-for-the-session.md),
[ADR 0122](../docs/decisions/0122-raster-canvases-keep-their-native-draws.md)):

- Three NoSave GMod effect categories, joined with saved particle/decal tags, preserve Source
  effect vertex color and texture factors. Blended meshes retain their geometry.
- Non-primary raster canvases preserve native color/alpha write masks and blending before
  RTX-only rejection and after injection. Explicit ray-traced targets retain precedence.
- Premultiplied transmission filters use a private legacy blend value within the existing four
  GPU bits; zero-alpha backgrounds are transparent. The shared CPU/GPU opacity helper is used
  by every ray path. Dynamic effect alpha/filter draws do not use static opacity micromaps.
- The fallback introduced by patch 0012 now links the renamed project. The correction is in
  0034, without rewriting the historical patch series.

Built in the assigned R17 clone on `codex/r20-render`: a5251896 (0034), then 1d53ee00 (0035),
from 51cf1b8b. Existing recorded NVAPI/RTXDI and DLSS/SHARC state was preserved. Both new patches
were exported individually with git format-patch -1 and absolute output paths. The Release/Ninja
wrapper verifies the exact patch/dependency tree and runs both shader/embed passes; optimization 3,
release DLL CRT, Tracy/shim off, download_apics=false. No GPU record grows and no SDK binary changes.
The new headers are listed in src/dxvk/meson.build.

Final DLL: 417,502,720 bytes, SHA-256
`0c961bd62c758d0e2d716c0371c5a772f4fc0aeaf760e5f723df82ea9522968e`, build identity
`remix-main+1d53ee00`. Imported once after visual acceptance through tools/inputs.py import;
base.json records all 35 patches. Dedicated test_gmod_effects covers category lifetime/snapshots
and the filter equation; the existing runtime suite was rebuilt in its separate unit configuration.
Evidence is in the R20-D worktree's out/r20d/runtime-filter-* and runtime-import-* receipts.

The R20-Q follow-up narrows dirty notifications to **19 option objects** registered by
`RtxInitializer`: selectors, upscaler/graphics presets and their upscaling/FG inputs and outputs.
Sky/weather/effect/category writes leave readiness intact. Device ownership and publication locks
are unchanged; genuine dependent edits and failed convergence remain unready. `test_upscaling_options`
exercises actual option writes/callbacks: 20,100 unrelated writes with intervening reads, selector/preset
transitions and failed convergence. Run it beside `test_upscaling_state` in `_CompUnitTest_x64`.
The re-exported **single 0040** still applies to `51cf1b8b`; its new hash is in
`base.json.pending_patches`. The test DLL remains unimported.

Follow-up source commit: `d9aba9be` on `51cf1b8b`; local `-NoImport` DLL SHA-256
`7fb71c9e745949df43750ff6d3f57cc379086aede87521778becd29510ce9ab6`. The dedicated runtime units
pass. With Q's merged companion and advancing sky, all 3,512 steady timer reads are ready, with
3,517 sun writes and zero unrelated invalidations; including selector transitions, readiness is
99.97%. See the [follow-up report](../docs/handover/R20-E-report.md) and `out/r20e-followup` receipts.

R19 adds `0033-Bound-the-DDS-readers-and-fix-the-review-s-other-run.patch`
([report](../docs/handover/R19-R-report.md)), the runtime's findings of the pre-release review
([R19-review.md](../docs/handover/R19-review.md)):
- **The DDS readers (H1).** A DDS file in any loaded mod could corrupt the game's memory: the partial
  loader wrote one size per mip level into a table of 16 whatever count the header gave, and GLI's
  fallback copied as many bytes as the header claimed from a buffer as large as the file. Both now check
  the headers with `gli::detail::dds_check_layout` (`include/gli/core/load_dds.inl`) before they read the
  data: a format GLI knows, sides of 1 to 65536, at most 16 levels and no more than the sides allow (a
  count of 0 reads as 1), at most 2048 layers, 1 to 6 cube faces, and 64-bit sizes with overflow checks
  that fit in the file (a volume's levels count their depth). The partial loader
  (`rtx_dds_file_parser.h`) also measures the file in 64 bits, checks every read, places nothing for a
  subresource the file lacks and maps only a file that still holds the checked data; GLI's reader
  refuses empty, short and unmeasurable files, and the fallback reads DDS only. Unit test:
  `test_dds_reader`.
- **String options read beside the render thread (F-01).** `RtxOption::getCopy()` copies a value under
  the update mutex. The menus' string reads use it (text boxes, the texture menu's legacy-emissive and
  thin-wall strings, the capture name, the language), and the fallback-mod list.
- **A texture the cache shares takes the strongest preload of its users (F-03)**, at its next draw
  (`PreloadStrength` in `rtx_texture_budget.h`).
- **The middle deck (F-04, F-05).** Its patch mask is probed along the ray at most a quarter of a patch
  apart (3 to 16 probes), and its moon-shadow taps read the mask where they are.
- **Config (R-01, R-03).** A file saved through a link keeps its previous contents in a backup until the
  rewrite completes; the float parser refuses NaN and infinities. `rtx.gmod.eyeWhiteBrightness`'s
  description says it scales all scene-adaptive emission (R-02).

No option, texture or buffer is added. Built in `out/worktrees/r17/out/runtime-src` on 0032 (`e095f29a`),
as `248fa6ee`, whose author was then corrected to the fork's git identity: `51cf1b8b`, the same tree
(branch `claude/r19-review-fixes`). The stored `d3d9.dll` reports `remix-main+248fa6ee`.

R18 adds `0032-Atmosphere-thin-decks-a-middle-deck-of-its-own-sun-d.patch`
([ADR 0110](../docs/decisions/0110-thin-decks-a-middle-deck-of-its-own-ice-arcs-a-milky-haze-and-twilight.md),
[report](../docs/handover/R18-report.md)), R17's limits:
- **Thin decks close.** `nvdfProfileDepthKm` is a weather field; overcast, drizzle and fog draw 0.9, 0.6
  and 0.45 km decks at 0.25, 0.18 and 0.15 km, drizzle and fog baked at a cover of 2. The shape
  displacement (`nubis3ShapeVarietyKm`) shrinks with the profile depth, all of it at 0.6, none at 0.1.
- **The middle deck has a cover of its own.** A 2D patch mask (`cloudLayer2PatchSizeKm`, 14 km), read
  at the ray's entry, middle and exit through the deck, is the sampler's cover against a nominal of 1. The
  deck reads layer 1's body field `cloudLayer2FieldScale` times finer (cloudlets of
  `cloudLayer2CellSizeKm`, 0.5 km), and a ray that meets no patch marches nothing.
- **Plate-crystal halos** on the high layer (`cirrusArcStrength`): the sun dogs and the circumzenithal
  arc, for the sun and moon 0, and the 46 degree halo with the 22 degree one.
- **A milky haze.** The weather fields `aerosolAbsorption` (a scale on `mieAbsorption`) and
  `mieAnisotropy`; hazy has 0.12 and 0.8.
- **The twilight** keeps the sky LUT whole to half of `twilightFadeDepth` (16 degrees) and fades it out
  over the other half.

No texture or buffer is added; `AtmosphereArgs` grows by one 16-byte row. Built in
`out/worktrees/r17/out/runtime-src` on 0031 (`80c4a8cb`), as `e095f29a`.

R17 adds `0031-Atmosphere-cloud-genera-per-weather-a-sun-disc-and-a.patch`
([ADR 0109](../docs/decisions/0109-cloud-genera-per-weather-a-sun-disc-and-a-high-cloud-layer.md),
[report](../docs/handover/R17-report.md)). Each weather owns its cloud genera through fifteen new
weather fields, and its presets map to them:
- the low layer's base, edge billows, cell size and bake cover (`nvdfNominalCoverage`, a step; above 1
  a closed deck);
- the middle deck;
- the high layer's cover, kinds and optical depth.

Numos also draws the sun's disc for the camera. A 2D high cloud layer at 9 km adds fibrous cirrus, a
cirrostratus veil with the 22 degree halo and cirrocumulus grains. Cost at 3840x2160: the high layer
nothing measurable, the middle deck 0.3-1.2 ms where drawn. Built in
`out/worktrees/r17/out/runtime-src` on 0030 (`9907d412`), as `80c4a8cb`.

R13-F adds `0030-Load-material-preloads-at-their-first-draw-instead-o.patch`
([ADR 0103](../docs/decisions/0103-material-preloads-load-at-their-first-draw.md),
[report](../docs/handover/R13-F-report.md)): a USD material's `preload_textures` no longer loads every
mip of every texture when its mod loads. Such a texture starts at its smallest mips, as a streamed
texture does. The first `addTexture` of it (the frame an instance first draws the material) pins it and
stages every mip synchronously; the upload goes with that frame's others in
`submitTexturesToDeviceLocal`, before the scene is built and traced, so the frame that first draws the
material already samples the whole chain. From then on it is a preload as before, and patch 0026's
pressure rule still releases it while undrawn. A material drawn in the frame its mod loaded may find the
upload of its smallest mips still waiting: that upload is replaced by one of every mip, in the same
frame; a texture whose load is on the worker thread is finished synchronously by the next frames.
Textures too large to stream, the Remix API's and dome lights' preloads, and everything while
`rtx.texturemanager.neverDowngradeTextures` is on load whole with the mod.
`rtx.texturemanager.preloadOnFirstDraw` (default True) turns it off for materials loaded afterwards.
`[RTX Preload]` log lines report each frame with first draws: textures, bytes, staging time, and what
still waits. Rule and unit check: `preloadWaitsForFirstDraw` in `rtx_texture_budget.h`,
`test_texture_budget_pressure`. Measured as 0029 on 0028 (`claude/r13-first-draw`), then cherry-picked
onto R13-D's 0029 (`claude/r13-option-lock` a816a673) as branch `claude/r13-first-draw-0030` in
`out/worktrees/r10-eyes/out/runtime-src`, which built the packaged DLL.

R13-D adds `0029-Lock-RtxOption-edits-made-beside-the-render-thread-s.patch`
([report](../docs/handover/R13-D-report.md)): whatever reads or writes an option's layer values or
the dirty option map holds the update mutex (the rule is at `getUpdateMutex()` in `rtx_option.h`).
`readOption`, which `remixapi_SetConfigVariable` calls on the game's thread, and
`clearFromStrongerLayers` take it; `acquireLayer` and `releaseLayer` take it after the layer mutex, as
`applyPendingValues` does; the Remix menu, which draws on the game's thread, takes it for Discard
Changes, saving, Delete All, the migrations and its unsaved and misplaced counts, and holds the layer
mutex over its Option Layers list. `applyPendingValues` keeps the lock between its passes unless a
callback runs, and up to its final clear, so an edit from another thread is resolved in this frame or
the next instead of being dropped. Stress test: `test_rtx_option_threads`.

R13-B adds six patches ([ADR 0100](../docs/decisions/0100-one-copy-and-idle-release-of-game-textures.md),
[report](../docs/handover/R13-B-report.md)):

- `0023-Log-host-memory-by-memory-type-mapping-and-purpose-i.patch`: the opt-in census
  (`rtx.profiler.memory.requestSnapshot`) also writes `[RTX Host Memory]` rows, with or without the
  memory profiler: each memory type's chunks and dedicated allocations, the address range of each
  host-visible memory object, the process counters and the committed address space by protection with
  the part DXVK's mappings cover. Allocation groups gain the memory flags they received, whether the
  application released the image while the renderer holds it, and the allocation's name.
  [host_memory_census.py](../tools/qa/host_memory_census.py.md) reads them.
- `0024-Keep-one-copy-of-managed-GMod-textures-and-release-i.patch`: for patch 0022's class (static
  managed 2D textures), `d3d9.releaseManagedHostCopies` (`DXVK_RELEASE_MANAGED_HOST_COPIES`; Auto, the
  gmod.exe default, is on below 28 GiB of RAM or 15 GiB of VRAM) frees a texture's CPU copy once its
  image holds the data and it was not locked for 10 presented seconds; a later lock reads it back
  first. `d3d9.managedTextureBudgetMiB` (`DXVK_MANAGED_TEXTURE_BUDGET_MIB`; -1, the gmod.exe default,
  is VRAM / 4; 0 off) releases images not drawn for 60 presented seconds, least recently used first,
  while the class holds more than the budget; the data stays (read back first when needed), the next
  use uploads it again with the same hash, and Remix frees a released image once no instance samples it.
  Other games keep both off. The resolved values are logged at startup; `[RTX Managed Textures]` lines
  report the passes and the CPU copy bytes. Policy and unit test: `src/d3d9/d3d9_managed_memory.h`,
  `test_managed_texture_memory`. The texture copy buffers are named `d3d9 texture copy`.
- `0025-Let-replacement-textures-give-way-under-real-VRAM-pr.patch`: under real pressure (within 2 %,
  at least 256 MiB, of the driver's live budget, or over it) the replacement texture budget stops growing
  or gives back the overflow plus that margin, whatever the configured percentage or fixed budget; with
  the margin free nothing changes. `[RTX Texture Budget]` lines report it. Rule and unit test:
  `src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_texture_budget.h`, `test_texture_budget_pressure`.
- `0026-Let-undrawn-preloaded-material-textures-give-way-und.patch`: a USD material's
  `preload_textures` pins its textures at every mip from the moment the mod loads, and the budget (with
  patch 0025's cap) never touches pinned textures. Under the same real pressure, a preloaded texture no
  instance has drawn for 10 seconds now gives way and drops to its smallest mip; when an instance draws
  it again it is pinned and loaded whole again. Under pressure the streamed textures also get 0025's
  limit less what pinned ones hold. While memory is free nothing changes; dome lights, textures too
  large to stream and `rtx.texturemanager.neverDowngradeTextures` stay pinned. `[RTX Texture Budget]`
  lines report the pinned bytes and count the releases and restores. Rules and unit test:
  `preloadPinChange` and `streamedTextureLimitMib` in `rtx_texture_budget.h`,
  `test_texture_budget_pressure`. For tests, `DXVK_TEXTURE_PRESSURE_TEST_BUDGET_MIB` caps the budget
  these rules see (a warning in the log when set); on a large card WDDM pages a background process's
  memory before it lowers the game's budget, so real pressure is hard to make there.
- `0027-Count-what-creates-deferred-managed-GMod-texture-ima.patch`: the `[RTX Managed Textures]` line
  counts the deferred images (and bytes) that sampling, a view, a flushed upload, `PreLoad` and a
  draw's upload created, so a burst shows which call made it. Diagnostics only.
- `0028-Fix-a-hash-race-baker-sources-and-unmarked-writes-of.patch`: the review's fixes. A
  memory-managed texture keeps its hash in an atomic that the hash API and `GetStableHash` read, so a
  caller on another thread (ToPBR from Lua) never races the image release; a texture tracked through
  `addTexture` in the last frames counts as in use, so the terrain baker's preloaded sources do not give
  way; a writable lock with `D3DLOCK_NO_DIRTY_UPDATE` keeps the CPU copy for good; and with neither
  option on (other games) the once-a-second pass and its log do not run. Unit checks in
  `test_managed_texture_memory` and `test_texture_budget_pressure`.

The [GPU probe](../tools/qa/build_managed_texture_probe.ps1.md)'s `r13` sequence proves exact pixels and
hashes through upload, released copies, read-back locks, a rewrite, image release, re-upload and a
device reset, against the original runtime.

R12-C patch `0022-Allocate-unused-managed-GMod-textures-only-on-GPU-us.patch` defers GPU backing
for unused static 2D managed GMod textures ([ADR 0096](../docs/decisions/0096-demand-loaded-character-classification-and-memory-census.md)).
The model catalog and CPU buffers remain ready; sampling, upload or `PreLoad` creates the original
image without changing its format/mips/hash. `d3d9.deferManagedTextures` defaults on for `gmod.exe`
only, with an explicit config or `DXVK_DEFER_MANAGED_TEXTURES` override. Other pools/types/usages,
conversion formats and `evictManagedOnUnlock` keep their existing paths. The shared initializer
preserves zero contents and queues a deferred clear before the upload on the same command stream.
The [GPU probe](../tools/qa/build_managed_texture_probe.ps1.md) compares allocation, exact pixels,
LOD, partial writes and original/new texture hashes. See the [R12-C report](../docs/handover/R12-C-report.md).

R12-C adds `0021-Log-opt-in-allocation-census-with-D3D9-size-format-a.patch`
([ADR 0096](../docs/decisions/0096-demand-loaded-character-classification-and-memory-census.md)).
Enable the existing memory profiler at process launch with `RTX_PROFILER_MEMORY_ENABLE=1`, then
request `rtx.profiler.memory.requestSnapshot = True` through the Remix API. On the next present it
resets that NoSave request and logs `[RTX Allocation]` begin/group/end JSON rows, with actual live
allocation slices grouped by category/type/locality, dimensions, Vulkan format and D3D9
pool/format/mip count (primary and resolve images). Pool `-1` means unavailable. It keeps images
still held by the renderer visible after the application's D3D9 texture is released. The registry
copy/update lock protects diagnostic metadata; grouping and log I/O happen after releasing it.
No hashes, resource contents or allocation/eviction policy change. The ordinary profiler remains
disabled. See [the parser](../tools/vram_census.py.md) and [Source probe](../tools/qa/vram_probe.lua.md).

R10-E adds `0019-Keep-imported-eye-white-emission-on-isolated-surface.patch`
([ADR 0088](../docs/decisions/0088-imported-character-eye-whites.md)). NoSave proxy/original texture
aliases isolate automatic emission to named eye-white surfaces; original PBR replacements retain
precedence. A NoSave brightness multiplier scales automatic and C-16 authored adaptive emission
through the existing luminance helper, preserving the saved adaptive scale. Its runtime unit test
covers alias validation, isolation, material inputs, C-16 normalization, brightness and option
lifetime/invalidation. R10-E builds with `-NoImport`; the committed packaged record intentionally
remains at patches 0001–0018 until Claude imports the reviewed DLL.

The new source files in 0019 are `src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_eye_whites.h` (strict aliases,
revisioned snapshots and automatic material inputs) and `tests/rtx/unit/test_eye_whites.cpp`.
Existing D3D9/external category snapshots preserve original atlas alpha/normal tags for proxy draws.

This repository's changes to the RTX Remix runtime ([ADR 0033](../docs/decisions/0033-one-repository-package-inputs-in-git-lfs.md)).
The runtime is the GMod fork of NVIDIA's DXVK-Remix, `sambow23/dxvk-remix-gmod`. Its source, with
NVIDIA's SDKs, is about 3.6 GB and keeps its own history, so this repository holds:

- [`base.json`](base.json): the fork's commit the patches apply to (`gmod-numos3` at `c6b48ed1`); what
  else the build has that the fork's tree does not record ([ADR 0034](../docs/decisions/0034-the-runtimes-build-inputs-recorded.md),
  [RESEARCH.md](../docs/RESEARCH.md) section 31): `submodules` built at another commit or with a patch
  (NVAPI R615; RTXDI with the fork's uncommitted changes) and `clones` the build reads (the DLSS SDK,
  SHARC); and `packaged`, the SHA-256 of the `d3d9.dll` the RTX package ships with what it was built
  from, which [`tools/check_repo.py`](../tools/check_repo.py.md) holds `runtime/` to;
- [`submodules/`](submodules): patches of submodules (`git diff HEAD --binary --full-index` in the
  submodule), named by `base.json`;
- [`patches/`](patches): this project's commits on top of it, as `git format-patch` files, applied in
  name order:

- [`build_runtime.ps1`](build_runtime.ps1.md): applies them in a worktree of a fork clone, builds, and
  stores the new `d3d9.dll` in [`packages/runtime`](../packages/README.md).

Patch `0016-Add-scene-adaptive-opaque-emission` adds optional `emissive_adaptive_intensity`
([ADR 0067](../docs/decisions/0067-scene-adaptive-emission.md)). The geometric-mean scene Yf and
paired exposure use a three-slot, nonblocking readback ring (eligible after two frames), then the
shared raytracing constants. The half-float material input occupies the unused high subsurface-index
byte and constant DLSS-alpha byte; the 64-byte material record stays unchanged, and input zero
preserves its previous bytes. Both opaque and Source-eye evaluation use the new intensity helper;
already evaluated interactions keep their radiance. Texture preload preserves the new USD value;
public API materials and baked terrain retain a zero adaptive input.

The feature defaults on for positive inputs; `rtx.adaptiveEmission.scale` defaults to 1,
`minLuminance` to 0, `maxLuminance` to 64, and `fallbackLuminance` to 0.18. Fallback is used when
auto exposure is off or before a completed readback exists. The zero lower clamp permits fading
in darkness. `[RTX Adaptive Emission]` logs the raw Yf, paired exposure, effective luminance,
sample frame/age, scale and enablement at cuts and five-minute intervals. These are the real
geometric mean and smoothed exposure; transition brightness is still affected by exposure's
0.15/0.75-second integrator. The combined package's only `AperturePBR_Opacity.mdl` lives in the fixes
part's breakable-glass assets, and declares the input with default 0 and range 0..65504; the runtime
part itself has no MDL. Its MDL preview retains fixed emission.

The built runtime itself, `d3d9.dll` and NVIDIA's DLLs, lives in `packages\runtime\files` (Git LFS), so
building the RTX package needs neither the fork nor its SDKs. Only a change to the runtime does.

## Changing the runtime

R7-A's branch build is deliberately **not imported**: the task forbids package edits.
Its new DLL, source identity, additional USD schema resource and test/provenance gate status are
recorded in the [R7-A report](../docs/handover/R7-A-report.md). Until Claude imports it during
integration (or separately approves unimported-build validation), the existing repository
provenance convention rejects patch 0017 against the older `packaged` record.

1. Make the change in the fork worktree `build_runtime.ps1` uses (or any tree at `base.json`'s commit
   with the patches applied), and commit it there.
2. Export the series again into `patches\`, replacing the old files:
   `git -C <worktree> format-patch --binary --no-signature --zero-commit -o <this repo>\runtime\patches <base commit>..HEAD`
3. `runtime\build_runtime.ps1 -Fork <clone>`: it checks that the worktree is exactly what `base.json`
   and these patches describe, builds, imports `d3d9.dll` and writes `packaged` in `base.json`. Then
   build the package (`tools\build_package.py`), test it in the PoC, and commit on a branch. Until the
   DLL is built and stored again, `tools\test.ps1` fails on a changed patch.

An existing source tree needs a configured Release/Ninja build with optimization 3, the release DLL
CRT, Tracy/shim off and `download_apics=false`. A missing `meson-private/coredata.dat` or mismatched
saved options stop the wrapper before setup, compilation or import. A newly created source worktree
is configured once with those settings through `python -m mesonbuild.mesonmain setup`, after
`Enter-VsDevEnv`; its first setup does not compile runtime targets before the wrapper's two shader
passes. See [the build script's instructions](build_runtime.ps1.md) for explicit offline setup.

A new base (the fork moved on): rebase the series there, export it again, set `commit` in
`base.json`, and rebuild. NVIDIA's DLLs change only with the fork's SDKs; import those from the fork
build's `_output` folder with `tools\inputs.py import runtime --root "<_output>=files"` (without
`--prune`, which would drop `files\atmosphere`).

## R6 T4 rebuild (2026-10-31)

- Source: base `c6b48ed1` plus patches 0001-0015; second-review fix commit
  `024a98665149e628db827cd0f9ce142828c14701` in the isolated `out/runtime-src` clone;
  verified tree `d6516436af1cabf354059b1ba4a8841550236eee`.
- Build: x64 Release, MSVC 19.44.35228, Meson 1.12.1, Ninja with four jobs, Tracy/shim off and
  `download_apics=false`. `build_runtime.ps1 -Fork <own clone> -Worktree <own clone>` reconfigured
  and ran both compile passes once with all review fixes. Saved Meson options and the diagnostics
  compile command verify optimization 3 and `/MD /O2 /DNDEBUG`. The DLL labels itself
  `remix-main+024a9866`.
- `d3d9.dll`: 395,540,480 bytes, SHA-256
  `c40f28e4371f7525dce01afad7316ae3efeabb2099c7ec19fe1df5dc3706ac19`.
  `base.json` records its source/patch hashes. The two shipped USD plugin DLLs are byte-identical
  to the existing inputs and were not imported again; only the changed DLL consumes new LFS storage
  (58,336,968 bytes compressed).
- No downloads: the already prepared clone has the recorded submodules/clones. SDK junctions point
  only to the declared versions in `H:/packman-repo/chk`. A process-local
  `PM_MODULE_DIR_EXT=out/tmp/offline-packman` resolver validates every package/link instead of
  invoking Packman's network/bootstrap code. Its Python and the compiler were already installed.
- The dedicated `_CompUnitTest_x64` build passes all 27 tests, including `test_memory_diagnostics`
  with a stale fixture. Patch 0015 now records the five omitted unit sources and the medium API app
  byte-for-byte from the user's staged fork index, without guards. All six compile; the five unit
  sources run in the suite. The medium API app is a separate GPU app and was not launched.
  Unit dependency staging used literal-path
  PowerShell copies because the upstream install batch helpers strip `!` from paths.
- `inputs.py verify --part runtime --deep`: zero problems. The combined package passes this
  worktree's `nlctl` validation: 1,008 files, digest
  `90d6fa1ae7206eea8eb4a0170ce5ccd8a5c22df3d532701eb2faf151895f9961`.
  No game session or GPU-loss trigger was run; see [TESTING.md](../docs/TESTING.md#r6-t4-runtime-memory-diagnostics).
- Repository Release validation: 23/23 CTests and 333 Python tests (two skips). The known guard
  cache-path limitation needs only that unchanged test executable copied to `out/tmp`; the local
  wrapper temporarily redirects its generated CTest command and restores it after the run.
  No loader/test source changed. The whole-worktree drive alias was removed.

The second review's configure-only scratch setup matches all 95 saved Release options and was
deleted after comparison. Its dedicated diagnostics test checks the five nonzero OMM counters,
reason escaping, PID-specific temporary files, two 10 ms sharing retries, preservation of the old
marker and cleanup after replacement failure. T2's integration reader ignores the additional fields;
see [RESEARCH.md](../docs/RESEARCH.md#r6-t4-runtime-memory-snapshots-2026-10-31).

Exact second-review import from this worktree (invoked by `build_runtime.ps1`):

```powershell
python tools/inputs.py import runtime --file 'out/runtime-src/_CompRelease_x64/src/d3d9/d3d9.dll=files/d3d9.dll'
```

Local second-review receipts are under `out/tmp`, prefixed `runtime-review2-`: `build.log`,
`verify-before.log`, `setup.log`, `setup-comparison.json`, `release-config.json`,
`recorded-sources.json`, `diagnostics-build.log`, `diagnostics-tests.log`, `unit-build.log`,
`unit-tests.log`, `unit-summary.json`, `verify.log`, `import.json`, `inputs-verify.log`, `package-build.log`,
`release-tests.log`, `release-summary.json` and `test-short-guard.ps1`. The first review's receipts retain the
`runtime-review-` prefix.

## C-16 rebuild (2026-10-31)

The isolated source commit is `8a5df5d8ef2e4529f20f7c07c195cb6dc3588afe`, tree
`1a6009a44590fe673282b7ceecf759548df646b8`: base `c6b48ed1` plus patches 0001-0016.
The completed build uses x64 Release, MSVC 19.44.35228, Meson 1.12.1, Ninja with four jobs,
optimization 3, the release DLL CRT, Tracy/shim off and `download_apics=false`.
Build identity: `remix-main+8a5df5d8`. The DLL is 396,802,048 bytes, SHA-256
`9906eec639b8768baf468daebb2f281c45f04754eaaf6cd60c0c5f7c883cc543`.

The R6 source, git metadata, configured builds and local dependency bytes were copied under this
worktree's `out/runtime-src`; thirty SDK junctions resolve to the already installed Packman
versions. Both saved Meson configurations and 694 shader dependency files in each were relocated
to this copy. When reusing another configured tree, relocate the shader `.d` paths too: their
timestamp checks otherwise keep following the old includes even after the shader stamp is removed.
The process-local offline resolver from R6 validates existing SDK links and cannot download.

`build_runtime.ps1` runs its source/configuration checks, reconfigures the version, and completes
both compile passes. `out/tmp/c16-runtime-build.log` records real shader compilation.
`out/tmp/c16-embedded-shaders.json` confirms the newly compiled auto-exposure and opaque G-buffer
SPIR-V are embedded in the DLL. The dedicated unit configuration passes all 28 tests, including
`test_adaptive_emission` and the regenerated `RtxOptions.md` check. Game/GPU acceptance and
eye-white tuning remain with Claude; no game or install was touched.

Exact runtime import, invoked by `build_runtime.ps1` from this worktree:

```powershell
python tools/inputs.py import runtime --file 'H:\BACKUP_20260815\Modding\!NVIDIA-RTX-Remix\out\worktrees\c16-runtime\out\runtime-src\_CompRelease_x64\src\d3d9\d3d9.dll=files/d3d9.dll'
```

The MDL declaration is the only other imported input (plain text):

```powershell
python tools/inputs.py import fixes --file 'out/c16-mdl/AperturePBR_Opacity.mdl=garrysmod/rtx-remix/mods/base_mod/breakable_glass/assets/remix_materials/AperturePBR_Opacity.mdl'
```

Local evidence is under `out/tmp/c16-*`: build/verification logs, saved Release options, shader
relocation and embedded-shader receipts, final runtime unit build/tests, MDL import, package and
repository checks. See [TESTING.md](../docs/TESTING.md#c-16-scene-adaptive-emission) for final gate
results and the project manager's GPU acceptance cases.

Final offline gates pass: exact source verification, deep input verification (zero problems),
the 1,023-file combined package's `--require-nlctl` validation, and plain
`tools/test.ps1 -Config Release` (24 CTests; 376 Python tests, two skips). The guard test needs no
path workaround here. Only the DLL's new 58,495,348-byte xz LFS object consumes binary storage.
