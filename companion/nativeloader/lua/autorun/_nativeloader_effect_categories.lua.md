# _nativeloader_effect_categories.lua

R20-D's automatic Source particle/decal observer ([ADR 0121](../../../../docs/decisions/0121-source-effect-categories-for-the-session.md)).
Runs at client autorun only when NativeLoaderRenderGuard proves the local RTX session. It is
idempotent in that Lua realm. Server and RTX-off starts return without changing APIs.

Inputs: CLuaEmitter:Add, CLuaParticle:SetMaterial, util.DecalEx, render.SetMaterial and
sprite/beam calls; the native RemixMaterial draw cache; material shader/flags and base texture.
The Think hook processes at most twelve discoveries and twelve hash lookups per frame. Material
lookups require a previously drawn hash, so undrawn character libraries are never loaded.

Outputs: only the NoSave `rtx.gmod.particleTexturesForSession`, `decalTexturesForSession` and
`legacyEffectTexturesForSession` options. The runtime joins the first two with saved categories;
the last preserves effect color/alpha on arbitrary blended meshes without reorienting them.
Hash sets are sorted and deduplicated, republished only on change, at most four times per second.
Lookup retries, two-second refresh, 4,096-entry cap, 120-second expiry and write-failure backoff
bound the work. Shared white/error/framebuffer textures are excluded.

The observer keeps native arguments, objects, errors and return values and changes no material.
Named util.Decal variants are discovered through their drawn metadata: it never calls the random
util.DecalMaterial resolver to guess which variant the engine selected.
It reads no VMT files and writes no files, user.conf, rtx.conf, persistent options, network or
Steam settings. NativeLoaderEffectCategories.Status() prints diagnostics; there is no process
exit code or new player setting. The guard's existing shader/resource limits apply unchanged.

Verification: [effect_categories_harness.lua](../../../tests/effect_categories_harness.lua.md),
through [test_effect_categories.py](../../../tests/test_effect_categories.py.md). Covers all
three classifications, normal world exclusion, shared textures, malformed/late/changed hashes,
API forwarding, bounded work, retry backoff, absent native API and inert server/RTX-off starts.

R20-D bounds animated/hash-heavy materials to 64 input hashes each and each published category
to 4,096 hashes. `hash_budget` checks a 10,000-hash response; no unbounded CSV reaches the API.

Status includes the shared i18n module lazily for its one translated diagnostic label (six catalogs);
technical option names remain literal. A combined production-file guard replay verifies that tail
forwarding preserves untrusted shader filtering and source attribution.

Live DX7 coverage: normalize shader _DX suffixes, read packed $flags, recognize standard white
aliases and clear stale observer bindings on both color-material helpers. The packed_flags and
color_helper scenarios supplement the hash budgets and normal classifications.

R28: the published lists are built again only after an observed material's hashes or kinds changed, a material with
hashes left the list, or a write failed and is still due. Until then the quarter-second step returns at once: with 654
add-ons the rebuild from thousands of observed materials took up to 4.7 ms of a frame (the issue 2 report). The
`quiet` scenario counts the sorts: none while nothing changes, one rebuild after a change.
