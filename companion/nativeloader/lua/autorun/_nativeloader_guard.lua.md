# _nativeloader_guard.lua

R24 adds the round's four new shipped Lua paths to the exact bundled-source inventory, as the repository's
completeness check requires: the RTX fixes' `lua/patcher/addons/cl_arc9.lua` and
`lua/remixlua/cl/cl_viewmodel_materials.lua` ([ADR 0135](../../../../docs/decisions/0135-view-model-materials-and-arc9.md)),
and the companion's menu scripts `lua/nativeloader/menu/loading_status.lua` and
`lua/nativeloader/menu/multiplayer_notice.lua` (they run only in the menu realm, never under this guard). No guard
function, wildcard or render policy changes.

R23 ([ADR 0130](../../../../docs/decisions/0130-an-engine-guard-for-lua-start-up.md)) adds three companion
paths to the bundled-source inventory (`lua/autorun/!!!!nativeloader_engine_guard.lua`,
`lua/nativeloader/notice.lua`, `lua/nativeloader/engine_guard_words.lua`) and one step after the
installation decision, outside the late multiplayer route: `pcall(require, "nlengineguard")`, the engine
guard (a material fallback that leads back into its own chain stops the game at "Starting Lua" under RTX)
and the start-up watchdog. On a remote server this early view is the only companion code the client realm
runs, so it loads the module here before any add-on's autorun. It makes the module's one `SetMessage` call,
with the words from [`nativeloader/engine_guard_words.lua`](../nativeloader/engine_guard_words.lua.md) where
this game can include it (a local game; a remote start keeps the module's English), and removes the function
from the table, so no server's Lua sets the text of a native message. `OnGamemodeLoaded`/`PostGamemodeLoaded`
bound the watch (`StartupDone(150)`), `Initialize` and the first tick end it (removing
`native-loader/startup-stall.json` when the start was reported and went on). The statement below that no
require is needed holds for the render guard itself: without the module, nothing else changes. In a local
game [`!!!!nativeloader_engine_guard.lua`](!!!!nativeloader_engine_guard.lua.md) does the same.

R20-B registers the new shipped `lua/autorun/client/nativeloader_upscaling_hint.lua` in the exact
bundled-source inventory. This single inventory line is required by the repository's completeness
check whenever a companion file is added; no guard function, wildcard or render policy changes.

R10-E adds the three shipped eye-white controller/matcher/VTF virtual paths to the existing exact
bundled-source set, permitting its tiny offscreen proxy-hash warmup through the same policy as other
companion rendering code. It adds no wildcard or permission for other add-ons.

Self-contained client RTX guard, identified by NATIVELOADER_RENDER_GUARD_V2. The loader embeds
this exact catalog-SHA-verified file after the supported stock initializer, before autoruns.
No include/require or additional runtime module is needed. The new content hash selects a new
generated cache automatically. NativeLoaderRenderGuard.version=2 makes installation idempotent.
R8 policy: [ADR 0086](../../../../docs/decisions/0086-inert-shader-effects-and-safe-guard-fallbacks.md);
[source audit](../../../../docs/audits/R8-C-addon-compat.md).

## Inputs and installation

- The generated initializer's __NATIVELOADER_RTX_GUARD_EARLY flag and local cache existence proof
  give installation="early". The local loader's DATA native-loader/status.json must report active
  RTX, preventing a listen host's served initializer/autorun from enabling the guard on vanilla clients.
- R19 (proxy F-02): that report must be this start's. status.json stays after the game exits, and a
  start through an off switch (-nonativeloader, NATIVE_LOADER_DISABLE=1, native-loader/disable) never
  runs the loader, so its old "active" used to install the guard in a vanilla session. A report from
  loader 0.14.0 or later (its `loader_version`) therefore also needs the RTX session marker DATA
  native-loader/rtx-session.txt, which the bootstrap holds with delete-on-close for the life of an RTX
  start: Windows deletes it when the game exits, however it exits. It is looked for with file.Exists,
  then with a file.Find listing (which never opens the file). A report from an older loader decides
  alone, as before; with no readable report, the marker alone shows this start's RTX. The decision is
  tested by [loader/guard/tests/guard_session_marker.lua](../../../../loader/guard/tests/guard_session_marker.lua.md).
  Why not a timestamp: GMod's lua_shared.dll links the C runtime statically, so os.clock() counts from
  when that DLL loaded, after the loader's whole start (a deployment can take minutes), and
  os.time() - os.clock() is not the process's start (Windows SDK UCRT `time/clock.cpp`, and
  lua_shared.dll's import table, which names no C runtime DLL).
- An active local start without the early view installs at ordinary autorun, installation="autorun".
- The verified native multiplayer bootstrap's raw marker in a private environment gives
  installation="verified multiplayer bootstrap". It can run after remote server autoruns. Global
  or inherited markers do not authorize installation. This route uses the real _G hook table.
- SERVER/MENU_DLL and RTX-off starts return without mutation or AddCSLuaFile. No native catalog API
  is exposed/consulted by this file. Status-file proof is an accident check, not a security boundary.

Read cfg/nativeloader_session.cfg for declared session pins. The saved nativeloader_guard convar
(default 1) delegates future calls/callbacks to originals at zero. A fresh RTX-off session restores
normal add-on setup; toggling the guard cannot recreate resources skipped earlier in that Lua state.

## Non-throwing capability policy

A deliberate refusal reports one bounded console note and returns safely. It never calls error,
ErrorNoHaltWithStack or callback quarantine. Actual add-on/native API Lua errors are separate.

| Request | Fallback under RTX |
|---|---|
| Invalid, oversized, unreviewed-format, cubemap, effect-owned or reserved shadow RT creation | Shared lazily created 1x1 RGBA8, depth-none engine ITexture; callers can use Width/Height/GetName normally |
| Exact reserved _rt_resolvedfullframedepth name (case/extension normalized) | Source's own getter texture; no recreation/reconfiguration |
| Allocator Lua error while creating the inert target | Reuse an engine screen-effect texture if available; not recovery from OOM/native/GPU failure |
| Loading/creating/reading any material, including DepthWrite, screenspace_general, LUX and custom programs | Original native material, arguments and returns; embedded NUL still receives the safe fallback |
| Untrusted render/surface binding of those shader families/programs | Shared transparent UnlitGeneric engine IMaterial; its mutators are ignored and associated draws stay inert |
| Unsupported copy, MRT bind, material mutation, renderer reload, recursive/invalid view | No values, no native dispatch |
| Audited rendering/reconstruction/world-building callbacks | Inert; Initialize and API-definition hooks can finish |
| NeedsDepthPass | False, including filtered registrations reached by cached dispatchers |

Supported color IDs are -1,0,1,2,3,4,11,12,16,24,25,27; raw R32F27 is an explicit MMDHL control.
The stock size modes 0-9 and depth modes 0-3 are numeric policy constants, independent of later
add-on enum exports. Depth-only mode 3 is refused, except in a supported color format: R27 allocates that
as a color target with its own depth buffer (mode 1; ADR 0141). Fractional dimensions follow native truncation;
full-frame/HDR modes preserve -1/-1. Rounded-up frame buffers are budgeted at rounded-up dimensions.
Bounds: 16,384 per axis, 64 Mi pixels, estimated 128 MiB color bytes per new target, 128 names and
512 MiB per virtual source file, 1 GiB total tracked Lua allocations. Canonical cache-name reuse
counts once. These estimates omit depth buffers/driver overhead/native allocations; they are not
measured VRAM availability. Exhaustion gets the same shared fallback, never another named target.

Material and CreateMaterial remain native for all callers, including known effect sources. There
is no evidence that loading/reading alone caused the tester's crash. PBR conversion needs the real
ExoPBR/GPBR shader and texture parameters; MMDHL's immediate path creates its own custom programs.
The guard never reads VMT text: plain/trusted/image/repeat loads add zero file.Read calls, and do
not inspect shader metadata or caller paths. Only the existing status/session startup reads remain,
plus (R19) the session marker's existence check at installation.

Untrusted render/surface bindings inspect native GetShader and, if necessary, GetString for custom
pixel/vertex programs or reserved base textures. Decisions and creation hints use weak material
keys; material mutations invalidate cached decisions even while the switch is off. Custom creation
hints survive native fallback shaders and later cached-name reuse with different parameters.
Entity setters resolve their material path through native Material, including !CreateMaterial
references, at the binding boundary. Weak-valued path entries avoid repeat native resolutions
while the material is live. Normal native cold loading, missing-material errors and VMT/Patch
parsing remain the engine's responsibility; Lua does not claim native load-time fault prevention.

The guard embeds 344 exact package Lua virtual paths. A test verifies the table against indexed
package paths/SHA-256 values plus companion/glass Lua, excludes the retired glass add-on and checks
internal collisions. Bindings and material mutations from these paths bypass the new material
policy; target/cvar/scope protections remain. Tests replay every path, including both fixes PBR
readers, the hotloader, companion, nlglass, advanced material editor, bodygroup tools and motion
importer. Untrusted reuse of a material made by one of these callers still encounters the filter.
There are no prefix/wildcard exemptions. Source labels omit the add-on directory, so a different
add-on at an identical virtual path, or code forging that chunk label, can bypass material filters.
Catalog hashes verify shipped bytes, not the runtime source label. This is a compatibility rule,
not authentication or a native permission; details and collision consequences are in ADR 0086.
R14-H adds the companion's new `lua/nativeloader/guide_pages.lua` (the guide's pages; data only) to
the table, which now has 345 paths; nothing else in the guard changes.
R15 adds the companion's `lua/autorun/client/nativeloader_imported_parts.lua` and the two rule modules
it includes, `lua/nativeloader/painted_shadows.lua` and `lua/nativeloader/solid_hair.lua`. With the
files other rounds added since R14-H, the table has 354 paths; nothing else in the guard changes.

Depth/inert textures cannot be bound or copied. Non-nil MRT slots 1-3 are refused, so mismatched MRT
attachments never reach native. Valid slot zero, nil MRT clears, normal color copies and fresh
color targets pass. Suppress incompatible render/surface draws rather than drawing a black overlay
or accidentally drawing with the previously bound material. Unsupported world/brush/entity
material overrides/mutations are ignored; normal material setters and UI drawing remain usable.

The audited GShader, FXAA, SSDO and SSR virtual source paths identify effect callbacks. Life Mod
module-origin APIs are also filtered because its own dispatcher invokes methods directly. GShader's
world/mesh builds and Real CSM's raster shadow Update/enable work are inert. Normal NikNaks color
atlases and ordinary projected lights pass. The two GShader lighting wrappers receive private
FindMetaTable/debug metatable copies with per-object readback, preventing shared native __index
nesting and cached-light resets from editing native tables. Native Remove retires the public
GShader projector-cache entries and rebuilds their indices, avoiding retained removed lamps. Source labels are compatibility policy,
not trusted identity; renamed code needs fresh evidence.

## Session pins and stock helpers

RunConsoleCommand, Player:ConCommand, game.ConsoleCommand and typed ConVar setters enforce pins.
DX/HDR, r_flashlightdepthres, mat_antialias, mat_aaquality and mat_disable_d3d9ex keep the declared
session value or captured native value. The critical pins have no source-name exemption.
`r_forcehwlight` is a critical pin at 0: set to 1, it sends every model Source skins on the GPU
through fixed-function hardware skinning, which gives Remix no bones, so player models and other
vanilla characters draw in bind pose around the pelvis (R3-016: Modern House RTX; R8: the
Backrooms map add-on). A player can still type it into the console. RTX map remasters
(`lua/autorun/<name>_rtx.lua`, `lua/<name>_rtx/`) may set the session's `r_novis` pin only: the Backrooms
remaster scopes `r_novis 0` and the fixes' PAS patch to its maps (about 13 ms a frame; 9 FPS with the
session's `r_novis 1` in the R8 field check). A setter called through `pcall` is attributed to the first
Lua caller, not to the native frame.
Quick Bloom's two raster bloom writes and Real CSM's competing raster-world lighting writes are
ignored. Existing noncritical source exemptions and motion-blur read compatibility remain.

Quoted command chains, newlines, toggle/incrementvar/multvar/cycle, alias/bind payloads (four levels)
and embedded NUL are checked before native dispatch. Renderer/video reloads require a fresh RTX
session. Interactive native console writes, existing native aliases and exec-file bodies are outside
this interception. Existing stock DrawBloom/ColorModify/Sharpen/MotionBlur/ToyTown/MaterialOverlay/
Sobel/Sunbeams/Texturize/BokehDOF and halo.Render remain suppressed; Initialize catches late definitions.
Ordinary drawing is not globally disabled.

## Callback and scope behavior

Early/autorun routes contain selected loading/render/UI callbacks through hook.Call. Unrelated hooks
keep registry identity, object self, arguments and first non-nil/six hook returns. The late multiplayer
route contains only callbacks from owned private environments; unrelated server callbacks retain
identity and vanilla errors. The separate capability filter wraps only known effects and depth
registrations, including existing entries/new hook.Add, timers and cvar callbacks. Thus a cached
original hook.Call still invokes those policy refusals. This is the narrow ADR 0086 exception to
ADR 0056's server-callback identity rule; it adds no general server-error containment.

Actual failures print original errors/stacks at most once per callback every ten seconds with a
suppressed count. Three consecutive failures within ten seconds quarantine hooks/timers/cvar
callbacks; success resets the streak. Gamemode methods never quarantine. Re-registering a different
function recovers the callback. Per-category records cap at 128; refusal flooding cannot hide errors.

Only observed Lua RT/camera/clip/model pushes are tracked. Ignored pushes create virtual scopes;
their matching pops do not consume caller-owned native scopes. While such a scope is ignored,
primary-target resets and secondary views are ignored too, preserving the caller's target. Repeated virtual pushes share a
counter. A callback cannot pop an active ancestor's/unowned caller's state. Completed Pre/Post
balancing remains legal. Real-error cleanup unwinds only extra known owned scopes and restores
known direct target changes; successful children contribute their chronological actions. Never call
mesh.End as an abort, guess depth zero, or restore arbitrary camera/clip/matrix state. FrameNumber
(or top-level PreRender) forgets stale unowned bookkeeping without native pops. Only live callback
chains count toward the 32-native-scope limit. Sequential stereo RenderView calls pass; nested views
stop at four, and effect-origin views are inert.

## Outputs, side effects and verification

NativeLoaderRenderGuard reports policy, installation, enabled state, blocked/errors/cleanup_errors,
allocations_by_source, allocation_bytes_by_source and allocation_bytes. Notes contain virtual source
locations, one per API/call site, capped at 128 per category; no private paths or exception bodies
enter guard records. Real exception text goes only to the engine error output. APIs/convars/hooks
change in this Lua state. There are no file/config writes, network operations or Steam changes.
This autorun has no process exit code.

[The LuaJIT harness](../../../../tools/tests/render_guard_harness.lua.md) executes this complete
production file with fake engine functions. [R8 call replays](../../../../tools/tests/render_guard_addon_replays.lua.md)
use original minimal snippets reproducing eight add-ons' calls, never third-party add-on code.
Forty-seven unittest methods cover 49 LuaJIT scenario invocations and the static path-inventory
check (24 replay scenarios for R8). The [offline cost harness](../../../../tools/tests/bench_render_guard.py.md)
measures 1,200 distinct and repeated paths against a modeled slow 761-mount lookup.
These checks prove CPU policy/contract behavior,
not a GPU/native-fault fix. Foreign remote initializers, earlier native aliases, later API overrides,
direct registry mutations, unknown shaders, native modules, infinite loops and driver failures
remain explicit limits. See Claude's QA procedure in the R8-C report after integration.

R20-D: ordinary camera closers End/End2D/End3D share tracked scopes; Start3D2D requires
End3D2D. Regression scenario `camera_aliases` checks 257 icon-style pairs, every ordinary
start/closer combination, nested calls, cross-family refusal, virtual pushes and error cleanup.

R20-D adds the exact effect-observer autorun path to the bundled-source inventory. No new shader,
format, MRT, depth or allocation exemption is added. Camera closers are installed once per API;
all ordinary starts can be closed by End, End2D or End3D. Composite Start3D2D scopes keep their
own family so a mismatched closer cannot consume a caller's matrix.

Native-mode correction (ADR 0122): End and End3D are equivalent 3D pops, while End2D, End3D2D and
EndOrthoView have separate native counters. Generic Start's type selects its family and cleanup.
The harness models independent modes, checks generic 2D cleanup and optional orthographic scopes,
and refuses wrong-mode closers without a native call. Native color-material helpers also clear
stale inert shader state; forwarding through the observer preserves caller policy.

R20-D raster preview compatibility: suppressed-lighting PostRender model previews use bounded,
cached UnlitGeneric base-texture studio overrides (256 materials, 32 slots) and restore every
owned override on success/error. Entity submaterial strings are untouched. Explicit caller
material overrides retain precedence. The wrapper catches late render.Model definitions and
startup replacements; suppression intent is retained for the protected callback because stock
helpers can reset the flag between draws. Early/late definitions, multiple parts, caller overrides,
returns and exception cleanup are exercised by preview_materials / preview_late.

Preview cache follow-up: use stable material/texture names rather than weak Lua userdata keys;
native lookups can return transient wrappers. The regression repeats 300 preview draws with new
wrappers without exhausting the material budget. The DX7 fallback uses a representative base map
through the global studio override; entity submaterials are untouched and explicit indexed/global
caller overrides retain precedence. Multi-material/custom-shader thumbnails are approximate.

R27 ([ADR 0141](../../../../docs/decisions/0141-depth-only-colour-targets-and-refused-base-textures.md)): a
"depth-only" request in a supported color format (HUD Mk.2 draws its whole HUD into one and that target over the
screen; stock GMod gives it a color target) becomes a color target with its own depth buffer, with one note in the
new `adapted` records; only the 8-bit color formats (0-4, 11, 12, 16), since default, float, 16-bit and R32F formats
are what real depth passes use. A material Lua created (`CreateMaterial`; `policy.created`, at most 8,192 names) whose
`$basetexture` binding the guard refuses because of the texture itself (not an effect-source caller) is marked by its
name (`policy.setLost`, `policy.lost`): untrusted surface and render bindings of it bind the transparent material and
the draws after them are skipped, rather than drawing its placeholder (HUD Mk.2's `models/debug/debugwhite` covered the
screen); a binding of `$basetexture` that goes through, or `SetShaderAndParams`, clears the mark, and `surface.SetTexture`
ends the refusal of the material bound before it. Loaded materials are shared and keep drawing with their own texture;
bundled callers keep native behaviour. The exact names of targets the guard refused and the engine never allocated
(`policy.refuseName`, cleared by `policy.allowName` on a later allocation, never an `_rt_` name, at most 1,024) are
refused as a `$basetexture` like the inert target, at a material's first creation and in `SetTexture`/`SetString`. The `hud_composite` scenario of
[`render_guard_harness.lua`](../../../../tools/tests/render_guard_harness.lua.md) covers each.

R28 ([ADR 0143](../../../../docs/decisions/0143-read-backs-font-definitions-and-slow-render-hooks.md)), three cost
safeguards. **Read-backs:** `render.CapturePixels` waits for everything the GPU has queued, one to two frames under
the path tracer (20-29 ms a call at 82 frames a second; HyperReal FX's two reads a second were 67 ms of every frame at
7). Each reader (the calling Lua file together with the file that called it, so two add-ons reading through one
shared library are two readers; through `pcall`, the first Lua caller outside the guard) has an allowance of eight
read-backs at once, refilled at 1.25 a second: a batch of eight and a reader that asks about once a second are never
limited. A reader that uses it up (two a second do after nineteen, a pair every half second after eleven) is
refused. Every request counts, made or not: a reader that keeps coming stays refused, and it is let in again when
its requests have fallen back under half the allowance or it has asked nothing for five seconds.
`render.ReadPixel` after a refused read-back answers, without a native read, from the last picture really read by
the same call: the calling line and the render target read, so two targets read through one helper keep a picture
each (eight a reader, further ones share one), kept until the next read-back's first pixel is read. Coordinates are
truncated as the engine does; a pixel the picture does not hold gets the picture's last pixel; while it holds none
the engine's own last picture is read and remembered; a call never made yet is made; a refused picture stops
answering after five seconds without a read-back. A file that reads more than 1,024 pixels of its own picture scans
an image and is never limited (it could not be answered from memory). `render.Capture`, bundled callers and
`nativeloader_guard_readbacks 1` (a saved client convar, default 0) are never limited; 256 readers at most;
`NativeLoaderRenderGuard.readbacks` counts `allowed` and `refused`. A tail call (`return render.CapturePixels()`) is
counted for the function's own caller: the frame is gone. **Fonts:** `surface.CreateFont(name, data)` with the definition the name (without case) already has, made less
than ten seconds ago, is not made again (the engine rebuilds every font's glyph pages on each call: 20 a frame took
a 12 ms frame to 29 ms); a changed definition, other arguments or a table with a metatable go to the engine; 4,096
names at most; `NativeLoaderRenderGuard.fonts.calls` counts the calls left out. **Slow render callbacks:** every
protected callback is timed (two clock reads a call), `PreDrawViewModels` is a protected event now, and one that
takes 4 ms or more of every frame over a window of at least five seconds and thirty frames gets one console line and
a record in `NativeLoaderRenderGuard.slow` (`api`, the hook's `id`, `source`, `ms`, `worst_ms`; 32 at most). A hook
added under a name is counted by its event and name (2,048 names at most), so another function under the same name
continues the count; a hook of an object and a gamemode's function by the function. Nothing is stopped.
**Timers:** `NativeLoaderRenderGuard.timed[wrapper] = fn` (weak keys) tells the guard that one function times
another: its records then name `fn`, a callback the guard leaves out stays left out under its timer, and a hook the
guard stopped after repeated errors stays stopped under it and after it. An entry can only add to what is left out. The `cost_safeguards` scenario of
[`render_guard_harness.lua`](../../../../tools/tests/render_guard_harness.lua.md) covers each;
[`nativeloader_lag_report.lua`](nativeloader_lag_report.lua.md) uses the table and prints the records.
