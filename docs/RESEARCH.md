# Research notes

VR round5 correction: Source LadderMove treats direction buttons as full-speed
inputs. Nonzero side components are not proportional strafing;8-way22.5degree sectors
are necessary for thumbsticks. Noclip must bypass water movement adaptation at every
layer. The round4 bone-mount precision certificate was circular: anatomical and
bonemerge rigs differ by up to16.43cm. Measured handles are restored; full raw mesh,
finger-circle, bone-envelope and rendered orientation witnesses replace that claim.
Historical medium-sim-16 used x=0,5degree yaw amplitude but only1.04..1.26degree sampled
spans, and water physical velocity lag2.85..2.93degrees under the3degree bound; this is
Source acceleration/friction response to continuing head rotation, not command steering
error. Old native/flat/performance receipts used PoC261104; current PoC is261112.

Q second-review native correction (2026-11-12; supersedes the earlier yaw-only
ladder interpretation below): Source's real gm_construct ladder803 follows the head's
pitch as well as its yaw. Flattening pitch made Forward and Back both ascend. The
shared movement basis now preserves normal head-directed ladder movement, keeps the
original command direction buttons, and never derives them from the late accepted
head sync. Water also follows head pitch/yaw with or without a weapon; gun aim stays
independent (`sh_move_basis.lua`, `cl_core.lua`, `cl_move.lua`).

Limited simulation `out/vr/v4q/review2/medium-sim-16` on frozen review4/dadf9feb passes
15 permanent-world ladder/water cases, Hands and gun+/-45. Head yaw moves through5deg;
accepted-head lag reaches.3866deg. Ladder up/down/idle is18/-27/0 Source units in all
three modes, with zero lateral displacement/side buttons. World-wish error is at most
2.081e-5deg. Fixed1.5s water settling precedes ten unfrozen observations. Desired-speed
parity stays within.25unit/s and physical mean-velocity parity within2units/s. No world
target is spawned/removed; no ladder type, water level or observed motion is forced.

The physical gun and converged eye command are different witnesses. W draws its gun
along the controller aim; command aim points from the eye toward the gun ray target.
The limited probe measures the rendered pistol's -Forward axis at +/-45 within the
unchanged1deg bound, separately from command pitch. A retained mutation rejects the
old conflation (`test_vr_medium_poc.py`, barrel-vs-command-before.log).

The Steam field update reached261112 while PoC remains261104. Comparing PoC with the
field's latest manifests gave false stock mismatches. Full pinned verification against
cached official4001_8532700529041238050 /4002_4618021864461761722 proves all2877 files,
zero missing/resized/changed. `field_snapshot.py --manifest` and
`vr_session.py --depot-manifest` retain explicit revisions in the transaction; missing
pins fail closed. No Steam depot bytes were written and verification was never skipped.

Q4 frozen review2 measurements (2026-11-12; exact identities in
[the current report](handover/VR-V4-report.md)): idle pistol/SMG/physgun on construct
submit about45 pairs/s at90Hz, GPU covered-work means12.188/12.295/12.147ms and whole
game-thread CPU7.713/7.555/7.398ms per submitted pair. Those are different quantities;
elapsed GPU spans19.748/19.680/19.986ms include gaps. Short render-thread CPU samples
are quantized (physgun steady samples all zero); its4.080ms all-lifetime cumulative
average includes warmup/captures and is not substituted for steady CPU.

At3840x2160 construct still uses centre3112x2752/traced1556x1376, GPU work12.544ms and
44.992 pairs/s. Modern House at720p/4K also keeps those sizes, GPU work17.561/17.604ms,
29.795/31.476 pairs/s, and67.275/75.581% compositor reprojection. No dropped presents or
new crashes. House720's measured mean eye warp1.00924ms exceeds the1.0ms reference
budget; keep this open and retain the criterion. These complete measurements do not
constitute near-depth/full feature or human comfort acceptance.

The five-plus-five alternating flat controls pass unchanged frame/startup/image and
client/server inventory bounds: median frame7.8606/7.8469ms published/candidate,
startup24.2/24.3s. Paired image differences .5011.. .6920DN are below the within-control
bound1.6241DN. No active session globals/hooks/timers are present. The expected off stub
is distinct from active V2-V4 code. Evidence `out/vr/v4q/review/flat-01/parity.json`.

## Q4 independent VR review (2026-11-12; supersedes the earlier circular checks)

The old grip-point comparison was self-referential; do not reuse its submillimetre
figures as placement evidence. `companion/tests/fixtures/vr_mesh_witnesses.json` keeps
563 selected raw posed vertices across 16 models plus recorded hand-bone frames and
source hashes. `vr_mesh_witness.lua` derives the grasp from mesh regions and hand bones,
without importing W's grip table. A 3 cm product translation must fail the retained
20 mm check; shaft models additionally retain the 12 cm hand-bone envelope.

`cl_weapons_mesh.lua` fits the stock shafts and barrel rings at authored pose. The SMG's
independent front-cap plane normal is about 1.875 degrees from authored X, not exactly
X; a real 2.9-degree product-axis mutation fails the 2-degree agreement bound. New melee
forward reach from recorded holding frames: crowbar .55556 m left/.55542 m right,
stunstick .38906/.38892 m. `q4_real_melee` independently compares the posed mesh end
to the transmitted server sweep and requires hook-only damage. Those are serialized
geometric consistency figures; no new live controller-fit or comfort result is implied.

The physgun asset exposes a semantic `core` attachment independently of its numeric
index. The probe now requires that named asset emitter and an observed rendered beam;
even two agreeing wrong W/T offsets must fail. The product's numeric fallback belongs
to the world model `models/weapons/w_physics.mdl`, not every class called weapon_physgun.

Source's ladder code also considers movement angles and directional buttons when
choosing ascent. Encoding world velocity against a pitched weapon command is insufficient
by itself: `core/sh_move_basis.lua` supplies a yaw-only CMoveData basis in predicted and
server SetupMove, retains the reconstructed world velocity, and adjusts only ladder
direction bits. Gun aim remains in the command. +/-45-degree ladder/water regression
cases execute both sides. See [Valve's HL2 movement implementation](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/src/game/shared/hl2/hl_gamemovement.cpp)
and [CMoveData:SetMoveAngles](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/CMoveData:SetMoveAngles).

Opening VR Settings exposed a numeric echo: Derma's slider scratch/text synchronization
can send formatted `0.60` for a saved `0.6`. Guards on these controls' ConVarChanged
preserve the exact original string when numeric values agree; actual edits still apply.
The retained test fails on the previous page and passes on the fix, corroborated by
safe-sim-02/03 exact restoration. Primary behavior references:
[DNumSlider](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/lua/vgui/dnumslider.lua),
[DNumberScratch](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/lua/vgui/dnumberscratch.lua).

The limited resource composition requires a real painted vignette, not just a visible
handle: a recreated idle comfort canvas has no runtime texture to capture. Actual
movement during capture makes its real paint path observable. `safe-sim-03` and
`safe-index-01` capture all 21 roles including ammo/tool/wheel; native peak 21 of 32,
distinct source requests per Source frame peak 16. This witness does not expose the
internal pending-request high-water counter; the runtime's 16 bound is between drains,
not total live overlays. Diagnostic mutually exclusive roles are forced together for
resource pressure. Index: 1622 submitted pairs, no unmatched poses or submit errors;
scripted poses/recorded components, controllers off, nobody wearing the headset.
## The fixes' crash on the queued render thread (2026-11-12, Claude)

Four `gmod.exe` crashes in VR test sessions on 2026-11-11 and 2026-11-12, triaged by the VR work's Claude session; the
dumps and the tools that read them (`dump_ip0.py`, `dump_thread.py`, `sym.py`, `dump_rtti.py`, `dump_remnants.py`,
run with `py -3 -I`, which has the `minidump` package) are in the main checkout's `out\vr\v2\crash`.
[ADR 0192](decisions/0192-the-fixes-never-read-a-queued-draws-renderable.md).

- **Where dumps come from.** Windows Error Reporting's LocalDumps writes every crashed `gmod.exe`'s dump to
  `H:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod_RTX_c\_debug_tools\hangdumps\wer` (about 360 MB each). That install is
  read-only for agents: copy from it. A crash whose stack is gone (a `ret` to address 0) reaches no frame handler,
  neither GMod's nor Remix's Sentry, so WER's dump is the only one.
- **The chain.** All four: the faulting thread starts at `tier0.dll+0x12070`, a worker (the material system's queued
  rendering), and its stack holds `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary_win64.dll+0x23a71e`/`+0x23a837` (`HardwareSkinningHooks.cpp:3764`
  and `:3730`, the `R_StudioRenderFinal` hook calling its trampoline inside `__try`), `studiorender.dll+0x1239d`,
  `+0x22f1b8` (`detouring/hook.hpp:126`), `+0x233bfd` (`convar.h:460`, `r_forcehwlight->GetBool()`), `+0x41605b`
  (`prop_fixes.cpp:357`, the `R_StudioSetupSkinAndLighting` hook calling `GetBoneCountForRenderable`) and, in the
  03:08 dump, `+0x415442` (`prop_fixes.cpp:265`, the call of the renderable's vtable slot 9, `GetModel`). Three end at
  instruction pointer 0 (exception `0xc0000005` at `0x0`, parameters `8, 0`: an execute fault); the 03:08 one faults in
  `client.dll+0x5744c` reading `-1`. Lines from the crashed build's PDB (timestamp `0x6af185ec`, SHA-256 `477c2266...`,
  in `.claude\worktrees\eager-torvalds-992bf3\out\ci\work\fixes\x86_64\ReleaseWithSymbols`) through dbghelp.
- **What studiorender was drawing.** `CStudioRender` is the global at `studiorender.dll+0xb2470` (the hooks' `this`,
  `rdi` at the fault). In GMod's x64 build: `+0x08` `m_pRC`, `+0xE8` `m_PoseToWorld`, `+0x108` `m_pStudioHdr` (the
  drawn model's header; `numbones` at its `+0x9C`, `id` `IDST` at `+0`), `+0x110` the sub-model being drawn, inside that
  header (in the 08:03 dump `+0x3D4` past it, named `watermelon01_chunk02c_reference.smd`). The header pages themselves
  are not in WER's dumps. Models at the four crashes: `cube025x025x025` (after the fixture deleted scene entities),
  `watermelon01_chunk01c` and `watermelon01_chunk02c` (gibs), `wood_crate001a` (a crate swung as a bat).
- **Why a freed entity is drawn.** In queued mode studiorender's `DrawModel` queues the whole draw for the render
  thread with a copy of `DrawModelInfo_t`, whose `m_pClientEntity` (the `IClientRenderable*`, the entity plus 8) is
  only a pointer. The main thread deletes a client entity at once (`C_BaseEntity::Release`, `delete this`) when a
  prop breaks, a gib fades or a script removes it, possibly while its previous frame's draw is still queued.
  `pClientRenderable` then points into freed memory: its first qword was a heap pointer (a free-list link), and
  member vtables (`IInterpolatedVar`, `CCollisionProperty`, `CParticleProperty`) were still in place. Slot 9 of what
  the heap pointer points at can be an address in code, which `IsLikelyExecutablePtr` accepts. The engine's own
  draw passes the pointer on only as proxy data; the fixes were the only code on that thread to call into it.
- **What the freed memory held.** The old hook spilled `pClientRenderable` into its caller's shadow space beside the
  return address `+0x41605b`, so every dump still has it (`0x274397e3618` in the 08:03 dump). In all four the entity's
  first two qwords (the entity's `+0` and `+8`, the renderable's "vtable") point to one block `S`, and `S` has the
  layout of a dlmalloc tree chunk: `+0x08` `0x1be1`, `0x1dc1` or `0x29c1` (a chunk size with the in-use bit of the
  chunk before it), `+0x10` and `+0x18` both the freed entity's chunk (entity minus 0x10; a two-chunk ring of equal
  sizes), `+0x20`/`+0x28` children, `+0x30` parent, `+0x38` the tree-bin index (9, 9, 10, 9: exactly dlmalloc's index
  for 7,136, 7,616 and 10,688 bytes). Slot 9 is `S+0x48`, stale data 0x38 bytes into the other freed chunk:
  `tier0.dll+0x12a5a` (twice), `tier0.dll+0xad9d` and `client.dll+0x5744c`, return addresses inside functions. So the
  crash needs a freed entity whose equal-size ring partner held a code address at that offset. The VR sessions'
  allocations made that happen; the PoC's flat stress sessions did not in about 24 minutes of entity removals in view
  ([report](handover/queued-draws-report.md)), which is why the triage's dumps, not a flat repro, show the old
  module's crash.
- **An engine limit found on the way.** Creating and removing eight `ClientsideModel`s a frame ends GMod after about
  120,000 of them (204-237 s at 67 fps, either package): `CUtlMultiList overflow! (exhausted index range)` in the log,
  then a fail-fast (`0xC0000409`, parameter 5) in `engine.dll+0x34b6bc` on a Lua call path. Only eight were alive at
  a time, so removing a client model evidently does not give back what it took from that list (inferred, not traced);
  a stress test must not churn them.
- **The hooks that see a renderable.** In the fork's source only `prop_fixes.cpp` (`R_StudioSetupSkinAndLighting`) and
  `HardwareSkinningHooks.cpp` (`R_StudioRenderFinal`, which kept it for `ResolveModelToWorld`: the entity's
  `m_rgflCoordinateFrame` at the entity's `+0x3F8`, read with `ReadProcessMemory`). That matrix is used only with
  `r_hwskin_transform_chain` 1 or 2 (`ComputeFinalBoneMatrix`; the default 0 uploads `m_PoseToWorld` unchanged).
  The other studio hooks (eyeball, single mesh, flexed mesh, draw group, dynamic mesh) read `CStudioRender`'s fields;
  `model_draw_hook.cpp`'s hooks run on the main thread and never dereference a renderable. Other entity references in
  the fork are numeric ids.
- **`r_forcehwlight` from the package's `autoexec.cfg` never applies.** The module creates that convar at map load
  (`[RTX Fixes 2] r_forcehwlight convar ready`, line 174 of a PoC session's log), after `autoexec.cfg` has run, and no
  game DLL defines it (only `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary_win64.dll` holds the name); its default is 0, and neither the PoC's
  nor the field's `config.cfg` saves it. Every crash stack went past the hook's `r_forcehwlight` check into the bone
  lookup, so it was 0 there. The companion's guard also pins it at 0 on purpose (`_nativeloader_guard.lua`: with 1,
  GPU-skinned characters give Remix no bones and draw in bind pose, R3-016), so the cfg's `r_forcehwlight 1` contradicts
  that decision as well. Whether to drop the line is the user's call; the crash fix does not depend on it.

## Material colours above 1 under RTX (2026-11-11, Claude)

PoC, gm_construct, noon, 1600x900; evidence `out\worktrees\color\out\color\poc` (runs `01-rtx-before` with the
published package 0.0.0-dev.20261112014628+0c72c174, `02-flat-before` with Remix off, `03-rtx-after` with the
branch's package). [ADR 0190](decisions/0190-material-colours-above-1-capped-for-remix.md).

- **A model's `$color` is the render colour.** Seven `npc_citizen` (`male_07`) with `citizen_sheet` replaced by test
  VMTs: `$color` 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.5, 2, `[1.5 0.5 0.5]`, and `$color2` 1.5. After a draw, `Material(name):GetVector("$color")`
  reads `[1 1 1]` for every one in both modes (`VertexLitGeneric_DX7` under RTX, `VertexLitGeneric` at dxlevel 95):
  studiorender overwrites a model material's `$color` with the entity's colour modulation at each draw. `$color2`
  keeps its value (1.5; stock `wrecked_boxcar_gate` 1.8, `tree_springers_cards_01` `[1.3 1.4 1.5]`). A model's tint
  is therefore `$color2` (or a render colour, `Entity:SetColor`, `render.SetColorModulation`, which takes floats).
- **Stock materials above 1** (`hl2_misc`, `content_hl2`, `garrysmod` VPKs): `models/props_trainstation/wrecked_boxcar_gate`
  `$color2` 1.8, `models/props_foliage/tree_springers_cards_01` `[1.3 1.4 1.5]` (gm_construct's tree cards),
  `gm_construct/flatgrass_2` `[1.5 1.6 1.5]`, `gm_construct/construct_concrete_ground_bright` `[1.6 1.6 1.7]`,
  `nature/clifftrees_cardboard05a`, `maxofs2d/grass_02`, `effects/citadel_destroyed_card_02b/c` (`$color` 1.2),
  `particle/particle_smokegrenade1`, `dev/dev_combinemonitor_3`. No stock citizen material has one.
- **The conversion wraps.** `shaderapidx9.dll` (build 26229091, SHA-256 `7534cd56...8ca9`, the PoC's and the field's
  file are the same): `Color3f` rva `0x11b50`, `Color3fv` `0x11bf0`, `Color4f` `0x11da0`, `Color4fv` `0x11e50`, the
  only references to them four consecutive vtable slots at rva `0x7b568`-`0x7b580` (no `call`/`jmp` to them in the
  image). Each: `movss xmmN,[rip+255.0]`, `mulss`, `cvttss2si eax,xmm`, `movzx ...,al` per component, packs
  A R G B (3-component: `or ebx,0FF000000h`), compares with the cached `[rdi+0C88h]`, then
  `mov edx,3Ch` (`D3DRS_TEXTUREFACTOR`), `mov rax,[rcx]`, `call [rax+1C8h]` (`IDirect3DDevice9::SetRenderState`).
  No clamp: 1.2 -> 50, 1.3 -> 75, 1.4 -> 101, 1.5 -> 126, 1.8 -> 203, 2.0 -> 254, -0.1 -> 231.
- **The runtime applies it to the albedo.** Stage 0's texture-factor blending is kept only for effect textures
  (`allowsEffectColor`, `src/d3d9/d3d9_rtx.cpp:1161-1170`), but a later stage that multiplies the result by the
  factor sets multi-stage blending before that check, for a stage without a texture (`:1104-1113`,
  `rtx.enableMultiStageTextureFactorBlending`), and the shader multiplies the albedo by the factor, weighted by the
  texture's opacity (`opaque_surface_material_interaction.slangh:770-778`). `materialData.tFactor` is the render
  state's `D3DCOLOR` (`d3d9_rtx_utils.cpp:175`), so the runtime cannot recover a value above 1.
- **What it looked like** (`01-rtx-before`): the tree cards dark blue-grey (green and yellow in `02-flat-before`); the
  `$color2` 1.5 citizen's torso 40/64/85 against 42/79/107 for the stock one in the lit image, about a third of the
  others in the albedo debug view (`rtx.debugView.debugViewIdx 23`, set through `RemixConfig`); the `$color` variants
  the same as stock.
- **After** (`03-rtx-after`): the engine guard's menu copy capped 153,012 colour calls on gm_construct before the
  probe started; the client copy reported "installed by the other copy of this module".

## Disabling the RTX item: GMod's list and Steam's switch (2026-11-11, Claude)

Measured on the PoC with the user's account and their permission (released loader 0.16.0, fixture Steam library as in
the section below; evidence `out\unsub\poc2`; [ADR 0189](decisions/0189-steams-per-account-switch-turns-rtx-off.md)):

- **GMod's Disable button writes `cfg/addonnomount.txt`.** A temporary menu-realm probe (never committed) called what the
  menu's buttons call (`html/js/menu/Subscriptions.js`: `steamworks.SetShouldMountAddon(<id as a number>, false)`, then
  `steamworks.ApplyAddons()`) for 3829070317. GMod wrote the PoC's `garrysmod\cfg\addonnomount.txt` (it had none) as
  `"addonnomount"\n{\n\t"1"\t\t"3829070317"\n}\n`; the item stayed in `engine.GetAddons()` with `mounted` false and
  `steamworks.ShouldMountAddon` false; `IsSubscribed` stayed true. Enable wrote `"addonnomount"\n{\n}\n` and brought
  `mounted` and `ShouldMountAddon` back to true. Steam's per-account entry for the item did not change and Steam's
  workshop log has no line for either call. The field's file (2026-01-14) was not touched: the file is per game folder.
- **The loader honours it.** With that entry in the PoC's list the next start skipped the package ("disabled in GMod's
  addon list (garrysmod/cfg/addonnomount.txt)", generation 268, runtime inactive); with GMod's empty list it deployed
  it again (generation 269, active).
- **Steam's per-account switch is something else.** On 2026-11-10 between 18:57:49 and 18:58:17 Steam's workshop log
  (`workshop_log.previous.txt`) has twelve lines for app 4000, each "Set 1 item(s) to disabled locally" or "... to
  enabled locally", toggled within seconds; the user had meant to unsubscribe from a few add-ons. Six items are left
  with `"disabled_locally" "1"` in `userdata\322575385\ugc\4000_subscriptions.vdf`; each is still installed (folder,
  both acf sections). GMod leaves them out of its list: `nativeloader_addon_state` printed `listed false; mounted nil;
  ShouldMountAddon true; IsSubscribed false` for three of them, and the Workshop mount counts 772 of the account's 778
  subscriptions. So in the menu such an item looks unsubscribed, and only the per-account list tells it apart.
- **The module reads that list.** `api.rtx_steam_state()` in the menu printed "enabled in Steam for this account" for the
  RTX item (Steam's folder from `HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\SteamPath`, the account from `ActiveProcess\ActiveUser`).

## Unsubscribing on a computer with several Steam accounts (2026-11-11, Claude)

The user unsubscribed from item 3829070317 and RTX still loaded at the next start (field, loader 0.16.0). Read-only
evidence from that computer ([ADR 0188](decisions/0188-unsubscribing-with-the-loader-already-installed.md)):

- **Steam's record lists every local subscriber.** `appworkshop_4000.acf` `WorkshopItemDetails` `subscribedby` held
  three account ids for the RTX item (`923668359,1289192384,322575385`) and for 736 of 831 items; 22 had the
  signed-in account alone, 41 no `subscribedby` (downloads). Nine items were subscribed by the other accounts only, and
  all nine were installed with their folders: Steam keeps an item for any account of the computer.
- **What Steam logged** (`<Steam>\logs\workshop_log.txt`, the lines naming the item):
  `[2026-11-11 17:20:15] [AppID 4000] Unsubscribed from item 3829070317`, then
  `Detected workshop change : keeping unsubscribed item 3829070317`; the same pair at 17:33:39; at 17:36:27, the third
  account, `... removing unsubscribed item 3829070317`. After the third, the folder and both acf entries were gone
  (acf rewritten 17:36:39), and the start at 17:36:52 removed the package (deployment generation 13, 1,373 changes:
  "its Workshop item was unsubscribed, so its files are deleted"). Section 22's "removed at the next launch from Steam"
  holds only when no other account of the computer is listed.
- **The shared record lags; each account's own list does not.** The acf still read `subscribedby`
  `923668359,1289192384,322575385` after the 17:20:15 unsubscribe; it was next written at 17:33:49 (then
  `923668359` alone), three seconds after an account switch. Each account's
  `<Steam>\userdata\<account>\ugc\4000_subscriptions.vdf` (`"subscribedfiles" { "appid" "4000" "time_last_updated" ...
  "<n>" { "publishedfileid" "time_subscribed" "disabled_locally" } }`) was rewritten at the moment of its own
  unsubscribe: 17:20:15.07, 17:33:39.44 and 17:36:27, and none of the three lists the item afterwards. The record also
  kept `923668359` after the user had unsubscribed that account elsewhere, until it signed in here.
- **The signed-in account.** `HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\ActiveProcess\ActiveUser` (REG_DWORD) was `322575385`, and the
  key's last-write time was each login (06:38:46Z on 2026-11-10, the login stamp in `config\loginusers.vdf`; 17:33:46
  local at a switch), although its `pid` value was stale (31980; Steam ran as 35400 and writes `HKLM\SOFTWARE\
  WOW6432Node\Valve\Steam\SteamPID`). `loginusers.vdf` in this client has `AutoLogin` and `timestamp` per account and no
  `MostRecent`.
- **What the loader reads.** For an allowlisted item, discovery never reads `subscribedby`: the folder with its archive
  makes it a source (`loader/core/src/discovery.cpp:276-288`); it is "unsubscribed" only when the record lists it nowhere
  and the folder is gone (`:276`). For content packages any non-zero account counts (`:105-124`, `:228-237`). A folder
  that is gone while the record still lists the item is "not installed", which keep-last-good holds
  (`loader/core/src/startup.cpp:22-44`).
- **GMod's disabled add-ons.** The field's `garrysmod\cfg\addonnomount.txt` was last written on 2026-01-14 and holds two
  ids; the signed-in account's list has six items with `disabled_locally` `1`, none of them those two. GMod's menu
  still calls `steamworks.SetShouldMountAddon` (`html/js/menu/Subscriptions.js:57-60`, `lua/menu/errors.lua:21`), and
  `filesystem_stdio.dll` and `menusystem.dll` still contain the file name; the loader's `disabled_by_user` reads only
  the file (`discovery.cpp:135-150`). Followed up the same day in "Disabling the RTX item: GMod's list and Steam's
  switch" above: GMod's own Disable still writes the file; the six items were switched off in Steam itself.
- **The uninstall put back an earlier RTX installation.** The field's journal started over on 2026-11-07 (its `lock`
  and `packages` folder date from 02:50), when the RTX package's files of 2026-11-06 were still in place: the first
  deployment kept each as an original (ADR 0035) and the removal put them back (`loader/core/src/deploy.cpp:325-370`).
  Afterwards 1,164 of the published package's 1,568 root files were present and owned by no generation: every RTX
  add-on folder (`nlblood` 375 files, `remixbinary` 249, `mmd_hotloader` 132, the companion `nativeloader` 67, ...),
  twelve `garrysmod/lua/bin` modules (four older than the package's: `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary_win64.dll` 5,515,264 bytes
  against 5,519,360), dated 2026-10-29 to 2026-11-06. The user's console showed
  `[gmRTX - Binary Module] - remix::loadRemixDllAndInitialize() failed` from
  `addons/remixbinary/lua/autorun/cl_rtx.lua:14`. Modules that had no earlier copy (`nlengineguard`, `nlfsaccel`,
  `nlvr`, `openvr_api.dll`) were gone, as they should be. The loader moves such originals to a permanent archive only
  in a legacy migration (`deploy.cpp:1041-1050`).
- **Most of them were adopted, not originals.** The PoC run with the field's own 1,164 files in place (loader 0.16.0,
  the published package, evidence `out\unsub\poc`): generation 257 adopted 1,108 (byte for byte the package's,
  `deploy.cpp:878-880`) and kept 49 as originals. The deployer never deletes an adopted file (`deploy.cpp:925`,
  `Act::drop`), so after the uninstall (generation 258) all were there again and the console printed the user's line
  `[remixbinary] [gmRTX - Binary Module] - remix::loadRemixDllAndInitialize() failed` from
  `addons/remixbinary/lua/autorun/cl_rtx.lua:14`, with the old `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary_win64.dll` loaded and the system
  `d3d9.dll`. Changing an adopted file's time does not make the loader take it over: `unchanged(file, record, false)`
  hashes a file whose time differs (`deploy.cpp:212-217`). A missing one is installed as the loader's own
  (`deploy.cpp:862-863`).
- **The module's close runs at a normal quit.** `GMOD_MODULE_CLOSE` of `gmsv_nlrtxclient` in the menu state ran at
  `quit` with no client realm left: the fixed package released the 1,108 adopted files then (PoC runs `03`, `06`), and
  the next start installed them as the loader's own (generation 260, 1,108 changes, no adopted file left). Renaming the
  game's loaded modules in `garrysmod/lua/bin` at that point succeeded.
- **The published package's start crashed once on the PoC** (run `01`, 0xC0000005 22 s after the launch, during the
  first Workshop mount, after "Failed to create shader" and `DepthWrite` material errors; the runtime was active). The
  next starts of the same PoC, with the fixed package, ran to a normal quit. Not investigated; the dump is in the
  evidence.

## Q3 resumed simulation (2026-11-12)

Static lazy overlay handles need fresh paint. In the selected fork source `rtx_vr.cpp:883-890`,
the canvas callback finds matching live overlays, allocates their image and blits the painted
target; creating a later handle alone does not revisit a static canvas. The retained
`f_review_overlay_repaint` first fails at 1 vs 2 paint callbacks, then passes when binding invalidates
immediately and in the following render frame. Combined-sim-07 captures all 21 visible roles with
native peak 21, per-frame source-request peak 16 and no missing image/module/Lua error.

The same artifact's full-rate temporal control has head error <=0.0003663 units, no frozen steps,
walk/sprint/flight normalized step spreads 3.97439/6.56066/4.11348% and zero sprint-stop overshoot.
These are simulated virtual-pose timings, not natural controller-frame or compositor acceptance.

Stationary balanced CPU control `cachecpu-sim-02` has 699 uncached / 708 cached adjacent-frame
intervals, excluding 250 ms block edges. Whole game-thread CPU is 7.66720/7.43732 ms per frame;
cycles are 32.8440/29.7999 million per frame. Resolver passes are 4973/699 versus 710/708.
The former two-second alternating-frame estimate mixes work around PreRender boundaries; retain
its raw values but use the stable-block measurement for comparison. Windows CPU accounting is
quantized and these are scene-specific, package-local observations.

Two-hand targeting with a controlled 2,000-triangle native-body mesh/hit measures full A.Target
at 4.168744 ms/tick with the cache bypassed and 0.031149 ms/tick enabled (100 iterations), in the
combined run. Exact grabs still revalidate geometry. This does not claim a shipped model has that
triangle count or measure total server time. Zero changed-state sends are legitimate in the
stationary control; an empty Lua table decodes as [] and must fail a dynamic-message witness
without raising AttributeError. Combined-sim-07 separately observes 5,323 physical-state sends.

## Q independent VR review (2026-11-11)

The runtime's limit differs from the native module's: `rtx_vr.cpp:166-184` in the fork's selected
source checks `m_overlayRequests.size() >= 16`; `applyOverlayRequests:294` swaps that pending map
into a local map before processing source/window/removal requests. Live images remain in
`m_overlays` until retirement. `vr/native/session.cpp:628` bounds owned OpenVR handles to 32.
All 21 central logical roles (three arc dots and target, V4 placeholders, every panel/keyboard/close
button included) fit both limits through request batching; no runtime rebuild/cap increase is needed.

At baseline source `7e6700e1`, the retained review harnesses reproduce 15 failures across the reviewed
defects. The delayed-climb case already passes with zero through three ticks of common body delay:
the hand-minus-head correction in `56e1df1b` keeps a 12-unit pull at 12. Offline exact 2,000-triangle
stationary glove queries take about 1.75-2.02 ms before caching and 0.03 ms after on this machine;
these are LuaJIT stand-in timings, distinct from the later native-body game-thread measurement.

The NPC fixture uses the per-entity
[SetShouldServerRagdoll API](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity%3ASetShouldServerRagdoll), leaving
the player's archived `ai_serverragdolls` untouched. W retains the equipped weapon at Start, so
V2/V3's fixture must explicitly select `nlvr_hands`; testing a claimed armed main hand as bare hands
caused the first follow-up combined run's physical failures despite clean renderer/menu/accounting.

## R20-Q follow-up: packaged client bootstrap (2026-11-06)

The live menu rejected `remix.performance_tier` in `nl::config::load` from
`loader/client/module.cpp:190`. The packaged bootstrap was the R4 input: 456,192 bytes, SHA-256
`de92d0261084c5d7dd7bdaca279a19012bf412fc00a1cbd31bfc385cff2104b4`.
The current-source Release module is 460,800 bytes,
`f23c711c4e6b3678661cbed45cf34d034d064b0444cd45c77a3e8b66851c508b`; its real menu reports
`verified; waiting for the client realm` with the same current config. Main/pause warnings,
the simulated older-loader companion reminder, and menu-cookie restart checks pass with it.
`loader/client/bootstrap.lua:8` keeps normal single-player loading unchanged. The module was
imported once through `inputs.py`; `out/r20q/afterfix/bridge-overlay.json`, `bridge-import.log`
and `bridge-import-receipt.json` retain the comparison and import. Native trust/catalog policy
and the corrected Remix runtime are unchanged by this artifact refresh.

The combined corrected runtime `00124bf6` passes Q's six live hint cases: 3,140 ready / 0 pending /
0 wrong steady timer reads, 7,913 observed sun-elevation writes, sky running with a 20-minute day.
Real effect landing gives 50 wall and 101 floor decals, 229 landings and no trace misses. The
512x512 live toolgun screen records ready DLSS/DLSS-G 1/1 and 902 captures / 451 HUD redraws.
Evidence: `out/r20q/afterfix/acceptance.json`, `hints/`, `views/` and the daylight menu-session
inspection. Both old `b311f0d9` and new `00124bf6` runtimes load gm_construct at actual 3840x2160
in direct borderless and bordered menu-to-map runs, all exit 0 with no device loss. The earlier
failure's exact cause remains unisolated after the game/fixture changes. Controlled FX captures
retain darker stock ragdoll blood under RTX and differing CPU light probes; see the follow-up
report for visual/field limits rather than treating these runs as full photometric parity.

## R20-Q: merged runtime readback versus the running sky (2026-11-06)

- Current Steam build 26439081 uses depot manifests 4001/8532700529041238050 and
  4002/4618021864461761722. Refreshing the PoC's exact 21 size/25 hash mismatches from the
  verified field gives 2,877 matching depot files, 7,282,813,551 bytes; only the user-config
  autoexec differs. Full path/hash receipts: `out/r20q/depot-refresh.json`, `poc-refreshed.json`.
- Runtime patch `0040-Publish-live-upscaling-state-for-startup-advice.patch:291` invalidates
  upscaling state in every `RtxOptionImpl::markDirty`, not just its relevant options. Lines
  129-135 clear readiness; lines 45-47 and 229-244 publish at present. With the merged running sky,
  a 17-second native-getter diagnostic read ready 14/79 times normally, 140/140 while unrelated
  writes were deferred for seven seconds, then 10/120 after replay/resumption. Sun-elevation
  writes caused 536 ready-to-pending transitions while enums stayed 1/0. No getter stub was used.
  The 1/1 toolgun probe separately failed a 45-second readiness wait. This needs a runtime fix;
  [Q's report](handover/R20-Q-report.md) records the required stop and remaining live checks.
- Fresh 1/20 sky clock: 14.6662585577 to 15.1114792189 hours in 22.2610330582 real seconds,
  1.2 game hours/minute. Old 0/30 migrates to 1/20. Evidence: the two completed
  `out/r20q/hints-acceptance/` sessions, plus the seven-method production-Lua QoL regression.
- RTX 5090, 1600x900 merged package: Physics Blood's stress fixture peaks at 420 droplets and
  16 pools (median 9.1459 ms, p99 16.4200 ms); bounded owned blood impacts peak at 512 live
  particles (60 FPS cap, median 16.6474 ms, p99 23.2845 ms). The clean combat/stress session has 2,208 landing
  callbacks and no trace misses. `out/r20q/effects-day/` retains the console, native logs and
  32 native-size visual captures, including the real coloured stock dupe preview.

## R20-A: menu routes and physical release records (2026-11-06)

- PoC field QA found two stock-menu limits. Awesomium ignores inset, clamp() and modern flex
  properties, so the modal uses explicit edges, -webkit-transform centering and a computed font size.
  In the menu realm file.Write opens/truncates a file then errors at
  `lua/includes/extensions/file.lua:24` because File:Write is nil. Stock
  `lua/menu/mainmenu.lua:321` uses cookie.Set, which persists our choices in mn.db. Fixed bridge
  snippets use that stock API; the companion's normal client realm keeps DATA preferences.
- Stock PoC `html/js/menu/control.Menu.js:18` declares MenuController; `html/js/menu/common.js:71`
  sets Angular's hash prefix to empty. `/servers` is therefore the route behind `#/servers/`.
  Register an App.run location listener at script evaluation, before Angular's DOM-ready bootstrap;
  adding a run block from a later DOMContentLoaded listener does not execute it in that injector.
- GMod's [file search paths](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/File_Search_Paths) distinguish physical
  BASE_PATH (installation root) and MOD (garrysmod only) from GAME (all mounted add-ons). The
  companion uses BASE_PATH to read the journal and exact release resource, so a mounted copy cannot
  replace it. [file.Open](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/file.Open) permits these JSON files; its
  blocked filenames concern server/config cfg files and dump/database extensions.
- The existing manifest SemVer implementation in `loader/core/src/manifest.cpp:188` parses uint64
  core components and compares numeric prerelease identifiers by decimal length/text. The menu and
  companion use the same bounds and ordering without double-precision conversion. The separate
  published-release record accepts no build metadata and its exact URL is derived only for validation.
## R20-E: effective upscaling state, 2026-11-06

- R20-Q exposed a gap in E's isolated proof: the merged advancing sky cleared readiness on every
  dirty option. Q measured 14 ready / 65 pending reads normally, 140 / 0 with unrelated writes
  deferred, 10 / 110 after restoration; `sunElevation` caused 536 transitions. A 1/1 request timed
  out after 45 seconds. Source: branch `r20-qa`, `out/r20q/native-readiness.json`.
- Follow-up: `RtxInitializer` registers actual `RtxOptionImpl` addresses from the upscaling preset/FG
  code. `markDirty` passes its address; the store ignores nonmembers. This keeps generic option
  writes independent of rendering subsystems. The new runtime regression uses real
  `readOption`/callback/resolution machinery with controlled sky-like writers; live proof uses
  the merged companion's actual advancing sky.
- Corrected publisher: runtime `d9aba9be`, `rtx_initializer.cpp:78` registers 19 typed option-object
  addresses; `rtx_fork_game_state.h:76` checks identity before invalidation. The update/store mutex
  order is unchanged. Full runtime units pass, including 20,100 unrelated `readOption` writes.
- The merged-sky follow-up samples 71.31 s on RTX 5090: 3,512/3,512 steady reads ready (100%);
  including real selector transitions, 3,514 ready and 1 pending (99.97%). Normal sky makes 27,757
  observed writes, 3,517 to sun elevation; zero unrelated invalidations. 0/0 and 1/1 resolve and
  original 1/0 is restored. Evidence: `out/r20e-followup/acceptance.json`. Exact restoration verifies
  4,200 original files/registry; current-stock verifier checks 2,877 files / 7,282,813,551 bytes.

- PoC: RTX 5090 reports DLSS/DLSS-G/FSR 3 FG support all true. Startup is unready at 04:01:49.660
  and ready after presets at 04:01:52.054. Six in-memory edits read unready first, then effective
  **0/0, 3/0, 1/0, 1/1, 3/2, 1/0** (upscaler/FG). The new module with the old runtime returns nil.
  Both games exit 0 with no Lua/device errors. Evidence: `out/r20e/poc/validation.json`.
- PoC stock still matches ENVIRONMENT.md's original manifests, while the field names newer ones:
  4001/7488132547021413298 and 4002/7341198560151933050 verify 2,877 files / 7,279,873,012 bytes
  before and after. Rollback uses those verified real manifests; all 4,022 copied tree files'
  hashes/timestamps match afterward, with a clean rollback and lock release.

- The fixes' original disk getter is `remixapi.cpp:1111` in the bundled memory-limits source. Runtime
  `src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_initializer.cpp:129` applies DLSS/graphics presets later, and `:151`
  resolves their callbacks. The disk getter cannot serve R20-B's startup hint.
- In runtime patch 0040 (`codex/r20-native`), `rtx_fork_game_state.h:26` names the atomic wire value;
  `:46` rejects plugin writes to the runtime namespace; `:54` starts an unready device; `:81` records
  callback convergence. `rtx_option.cpp:356` invalidates readiness on every dirty option, and
  `rtx_option_manager.cpp:244` records convergence before its existing dirty-map clear.
  `rtx_initializer.cpp:184` reads actual DLSS/DLFG/FSR capabilities and both effective enums under
  the option update mutex. Publication runs after initialization and at every present.
- The GPL binding is `upscaling-state/source/remixapi/config_lua_bindings.cpp:69`, registered at
  `:290`. It uses an export lookup and bounded thirteen-byte schema-1 value, with no optional
  interface offset, config read or save. Publisher/reader checks pass with MSVC `/O2 /W4 /WX`.
- Pinned premake drops `!` in generated intermediate paths in this nested worktree. The direct
  module build failed with C1083/D8040; a temporary `subst W:` pointing into this worktree's `out`
  gives correct paths. The unchanged build script then built the 5,515,264-byte module, SHA-256
  `53da14f9269f042869510fe8be56b8b055263acd7c80a54d3e6178dbbfa94e73`.
## R20-B: startup readback and sky defaults (2026-11-06)

- Live QA exposed the first-run guide covering the stock hint notification. The guide opens at
  eight seconds (`nativeloader_guide.lua:452-456`); the original hint attempted at twelve. The hint
  now defers the whole decision while [vgui.CursorVisible](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/vgui.CursorVisible),
  [gui.IsGameUIVisible](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gui.IsGameUIVisible) or Remix's existing live
  `RemixConfig.GetUIState` says a menu is open. It does not spend native-readiness attempts or read
  DATA/snapshots while obscured. Closing the window reads current settings, avoiding stale advice
  if the player enabled both features in that menu. Four LuaJIT scenarios cover the wait and edit.
- The runtime's `rtx_fork_upscaler_ui.cpp:167-174` adopts legacy DLFG/FSR enable flags when the
  selector is None. The future native snapshot must resolve this consistency too, or report not
  ready; a zero selector alone cannot prove that a legacy backend is off. This is part of the
  documented snapshot provider's responsibility, not a file-based inference in Lua.

- The packaged fixes' `packages/fixes/licenses/oversized-skinning/memory-limits/source/remixapi/remixapi.cpp:1111`
  reads `rtx.conf` directly and returns empty when a key is absent. The binding exposes it as
  `RemixConfig.GetConfigVariable`; no live option readback is exposed. The tab itself warns that its
  drafts are not live (`nativeloader_menu.lua`, `remix_settings`). This contradicts the R20-B brief's
  assumption, so a reliable startup hint needs a native read-only snapshot.
- In the recorded runtime source (`dxvk-remix-gmod/.claude/worktrees/remix-i18n`),
  `src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_options.h:1482` resolves initialization callbacks with `device = nullptr`,
  then logs at 1485. Device-dependent `updateGraphicsPresets` is in `rtx_options.cpp:411`; the log
  therefore cannot stand in for the later effective state. No runtime files were modified.
- The current tab offers None/DLSS/NIS/TAA-U/XeSS/FSR and Off/DLSS-G/FSR 3
  (`nativeloader_menu.lua:76-82`). NVIDIA's
  [support table](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/) distinguishes DLSS on
  RTX 20/30/40/50 from DLSS frame generation on 40/50. The hint also requires explicit live backend
  support, especially for FSR 3; the adapter's name alone cannot prove driver/backend availability.
- Stock sandbox `garrysmod/gamemodes/sandbox/gamemode/cl_hints.lua:32-34` uses NOTIFY_HINT and
  `ambient/water/drip1.wav` through `drip4.wav`. `lua/includes/modules/notification.lua:177-191`
  sizes its label to content without word wrap, so the new hints use three translated short lines.
- [Facepunch's ConVar:SetString reference](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ConVar%3ASetString)
  confirms immediate writes for Lua-created ConVars. The migration runs at sky ConVar creation,
  before callbacks, avoiding a false player takeover on Modern House. LuaJIT's real sky startup
  harness measures a 1.2-hour advance per 60 seconds for fresh/migrated 20-minute days, and zero sky
  writes before/after 60 seconds when Modern House's add-on owns the sky.
## R20-D: camera aliases, effect colors and offscreen alpha canvases (2026-11-06)

- Stock dupe icons use 32 `cam.Start(view)`/`cam.End()` pairs per entity per outline pass,
  then one final camera (`gamemodes/sandbox/entities/weapons/gmod_tool/stools/duplicator/icon.lua:104-213`).
  In the locked PoC baseline, the two-prop request saved but printed 97 native camera underflows
  and produced a black icon (`out/r20d/06-before-rtx/game/console.log`, archived dupe JPEG).
  Ordinary camera closers were distinct Lua function objects in the RTX-off run. The guard now
  tracks all three closer names once (`_nativeloader_guard.lua:1185`, `:1295-1302`); the LuaJIT
  regression also covers 257 sequential pairs, virtual pushes and composite-camera mismatches.
- Physics Blood (3818841829) ships 55 Lua files. `cl_materials.lua:34-82` builds translucent,
  vertex-colored UnlitGeneric effects alongside native decals; `cl_flowdraw.lua:38-50` uses
  triangle strips with filter/additive layers. These colors are effects, not map baked lighting.
  The old runtime kept their vertex color and texture factor only when their hashes were already
  saved as particle, decal or allowed-baked-lighting textures (`d3d9_rtx.cpp` at 51cf1b8b:295-309,
  `:1153-1168`). Patch 0034 joins session categories at those boundaries (`:297`, `:1167`).
- Physics Blood's pool canvas uses 512-square RGBA16F scratch textures and a 2048-square atlas.
  Its `cl_poolcanvas.lua:1457-1476` tests float alpha as `(204/255 + 204/255) * 128/255`, then
  reads alpha from the RGBA page. Native returned 205; the old RTX runtime returned 255 in our
  sessions, with no guard rejection before the dupe (`05-off` and `06-before-rtx`). The runtime
  rejected alpha-only write masks before deciding a non-primary target should be rasterized
  (`d3d9_rtx.cpp` at 51cf1b8b:488-490, `:523-530`). Patch 0034 moves offscreen raster preservation
  ahead of RTX-only filtering and the post-injection skip (`d3d9_rtx.cpp` at a5251896:590-615).
- The automatic observer reads the native draw cache before resolving a material. The three
  NoSave options join saved categories without writing them (`rtx_texture_category_sets.h:75-88`,
  `rtx_types.cpp:416-422`, external submission in `rtx_fork_submit.cpp`). Blended effect meshes
  get color preservation without billboard reorientation or decal offsets. Twelve discoveries
  and twelve lookups per frame, 4,096 names, 64 hashes per material and 4,096 published hashes
  per category bound the work. Existing material/hash APIs need no new native module.
- [util.DecalMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.DecalMaterial) randomly chooses among
  variants. Observation therefore leaves named util.Decal untouched and discovers the material
  that was drawn; calling the resolver merely to observe a decal would consume native RNG.
- A production-observer/production-guard replay checks that renderer forwarders keep their original
  untrusted caller attribution and do not inherit the observer's exact bundled-path exemption.
  The forwarding calls must remain in tail position. This supplements separate observer tests.
- The dedicated runtime unit build initially lacked `libxess.dll` for the category-plugin test.
  Staging the unchanged indexed library under its D3D9 output directory resolved LoadLibrary error
  126. Its RemixCategories plugin was built explicitly. After refreshing generated RtxOptions.md,
  the complete dedicated suite passes 36/36 (`out/r20d/runtime-unit-pass.log`).
## R20-C: owned blood assets and the stock dispatch (2026-11-06)

- Multiplayer Lua visibility differs from SP: a package's private marker on disk was not visible
  to the initial client check until the server sent it with AddCSLuaFile. The first legacy MP run
  had one extra Utilities shortcut; the corrected vanilla MP run has blood=1, screen=1, shortcut=0.
  Both full and independent parts explicitly deliver the marker/adapter.
- Depot verification must use the PoC's own version. Its garrysmod.ver is 261026/2156; the field's
  is 261104/1744. Cached PoC manifests 4001/7488132547021413298 and 4002/7341198560151933050 match
  all 2,877 depot files (7,279,873,012 bytes); the newer field manifests gave version differences.

- Both raw analytic VTF hashes were confirmed in the native draw cache: drop XXH64
  `be79e0c9c18bc626`, mist `cac5d215d939df47`; their computed XXH3 counterparts are retained too.
  Authored opacity material entries, BC7 albedos and a .05 scene-adaptive intrinsic fill restored
  dark maroon tint and soft coverage (`out/r20c/integration-pbr-probe`), without a global option or
  Lua hash registration. The two DDSs add only 4,768 compressed bytes. The new parts total
  55,547,528 compressed bytes (52.97 MiB). All original analytic VTFs remain byte-identical.

- The first locked sessions (`out/r20c/on-clean`, `off-clean`) confirmed NPC red/antlion/zombie
  events and remote NPC dispatch. Engine amounts included 35 (pistol), 15/60 (other hits), and 50
  for the NPC shooter's scripted bullet. Server ragdolls instead dispatched `Impact`, damage 2 or
  536870914, surface property 39 (flesh), unit scale and a zero Normal; Start/Origin provide direction.
  GetBloodColor may be nil. The adapter preserves native effects and infers ragdoll colour only
  where needed. A missed pistol ray was corrected in the fixture by aiming at a chest bone closer up.
- A material/particle sampler measured the original drops moving 20–110 units in .3 seconds and
  hitting the floor. Missing landing stains were a world-validation bug: the PoC reports
  `IsValid(game.GetWorld()) == false`. Using HitWorld fixed it: `integration-ragdolls` recorded
  2,447 collisions, no trace misses and a strict 384-stain first epoch; explicit clearing then
  admitted 200 more stains. The particle budget stayed at 512 live. Vanilla HUD diagnostics show
  the procedural texture is a valid grey alpha bead and normal particle tints are red.
- The early D runtime `ee3d239c...` rendered these particles as black silhouettes despite correct
  texture dimensions/tint and an active generic observer. The separate Sprite comparison also
  exposed opaque quads at its default mode. Final acceptance therefore runs without diagnostic
  shaders (shared hashes affect runtime classification), against D's later runtime candidate.

- The blood project's `tools/shapes.py` identifies eighteen `CODEX_UNITS` patterns separately from
  `bo_blood*`, `bo_yblood*`, flesh and stains. `tools/publish.py:185-192` makes the old droplet from
  `work/maps/bo_blood8/neutral.png`, so even the nominal companion output contains a derivative that
  cannot ship here. `tools/prepare_blood.py` selects 109 source files and excludes 270 output files;
  the committed audit retains paths/hashes. The new index has 36 pattern VTFs, 72 DDSs, two original
  analytic particle VTFs and 72 hash overrides. Added LFS: 55,518,444 blood bytes + 24,316 screen
  bytes = 55,542,760 compressed bytes (52.97 MiB). No source PNGs/reference images are imported.
- [Valve's `util_shared.cpp:714-744,822-831`](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/src/game/shared/util_shared.cpp)
  sends origin, incoming direction, blood colour and blood amount as `bloodimpact` CEffectData;
  multiplayer multiplies amount by five before clamping it at 255. Amount is a proxy, not reliable
  damage or exit-wound information. R20-C uses a square-root response around 12, capped .4–2.8, so
  differing amounts retain differing spray sizes instead of all saturating at eight.
- [Valve's callback](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/src/game/client/fx_blood.cpp)
  selects red/green/yellow and episodic PCF systems, orienting them opposite the supplied direction.
  [Facepunch documents](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.Effect) `allowOverride=false` for
  forwarding unchanged data to the engine. No PCF or stock material needs replacing.
- `loader/client/bootstrap.lua:105-110` gives each verified file its own include environment.
  The screen's packaged autorun adapter therefore also checks `DTScreen.Loaded`, covering a
  server-delivered standalone before verified local loading. The early blood bootstrap retires
  only legacy-owned callbacks/hooks and wrappers whose exact source is the old core. Other add-on
  wrapper chains are preserved.
- `tools/tests/test_render_guard_addons.py` inventories legacy exemptions. New screen/blood paths
  intentionally receive none: R20-C uses ordinary particle/decal APIs for R20-D's generic policy.


## R13-F: when a texture loaded during a frame's draws reaches that frame (2026-11-03, Claude)

Runtime source at `403b2336` (patch 0028); the patch, the A/B and its evidence are in the
[R13-F report](handover/R13-F-report.md).

- **Frame order.** The game's draws reach `SceneManager::processDrawCallState`, whose
  `createSurfaceMaterial` calls `trackTexture` and so `RtxTextureManager::addTexture` for every texture
  of the material, every frame it is drawn (`rtx_scene_manager.cpp:1824-1841`, `:2215-2229`). Then
  `RtxContext::injectRTX` calls `submitTexturesToDeviceLocal` (`rtx_context.cpp:658`), which creates each
  ready texture's image and records its copy, before `prepareSceneData` builds the scene and before the
  trace. The texture manager's `garbageCollection` runs after the trace, from
  `copySamplerFeedbackToHost` (`rtx_texture_manager.cpp:1472`). So a texture staged synchronously while
  a frame's draws are processed is sampled whole by that same frame.
- **The synchronous path** (`scheduleTextureLoad(tex, false)` -> `AsyncRunner::queueAdd`, async false)
  stages on the calling thread into `m_synchronousAlloc`, a `DxvkStagingBuffer` of 4 MiB whose larger
  requests each get their own host-visible buffer (`dxvk_staging.cpp`); it is freed once the copy
  retires. It does nothing for a texture already `kQueuedForUpload`.
- **A purge is explicit only.** `purgeResidentTextures` (which makes `addTexture` reload a pinned
  preload whole at its next draw) runs for the menu's free-texture buttons, the Remix API's
  `RequestTextureVramFree` and a resolution change with `rtx.reloadTextureWhenResolutionChanged`
  (`rtx_scene_manager.cpp:3660`, `rtx_context.cpp:329`), not at a map change. No add-on in the package
  calls the API (the fixes' `ForceCleanup` wraps it, unused from Lua).
- **Measured, patch 0030 (as 0029 on 0028) on the PoC** (3840x2160, Samsung 980 PRO NVMe, files in the
  file cache):
  staging a character's whole maps on the render thread took 101-201 ms for 313-529 MB (2.3-3.1 GB/s).
  The frame that drew the character first lasted 112-324 ms. Replacement-texture bytes changed once,
  one game frame after the hotloader's presentation, by the character's whole maps.
- **The hotloader's own first-spawn freezes**, with either runtime: two consecutive frames of
  0.8-1.3 s about 110-145 frames (two seconds) before Robin or Evernight appears, two of 0.2-0.3 s
  for Guinaifen, while it loads the model; then two or three frames of 60-100 ms at the presentation.
- **Cold reads.** Through a file mapping, with every byte copied out as `packImageData` does, copies
  made with `xcopy /J` (unbuffered, so not in the cache) read at 0.69-0.89 GB/s against 1.34-1.39 GB/s
  from the cache (Python's copy): 0.4-0.7 s per GB more on that drive (`r13-f/cold_read.py`).
- **The three character packs** hold 170 preloaded textures, 2.38 GB; drawing all four characters
  loads 111 of them (1.66 GB). The other 59 (0.72 GB) belong to parts the probe's scenes never draw
  and stay at their tails.

## R13-D: the option crash, proven (2026-11-03, Claude)

The R13 integration notes below record the crash. Its cause is now proven, and runtime patch 0029
fixes it ([R13-D report](handover/R13-D-report.md)).

- **What the dump's registers say.** `RtxOptionImpl::resolveValue+0x3e` is
  `mov edx, dword ptr [rcx+50h]` (0028 build, RVA `0x1b7dfe`), which reads `m_type`.
  `RtxOptionImpl` lays out its vptr, `minValue` and `maxValue` (`std::optional<GenericValue>`, 16
  bytes each), `m_hash`, `m_name`, `m_category`, `m_environment` and `m_description` first, so
  `m_type` is at `0x50`, and `m_resolvedValue` at `0x58`.
  - The crash had `rcx=rdi=0` (`this`), `rdx=r14=0x58` (`&m_resolvedValue`) and `rbp=r8=0` (no
    excluded layer).
  - So `applyPendingValues` resolved a dirty-map entry holding `nullptr`.
  - That map is an `std::unordered_map` (`fast_unordered_cache`), and `markDirty()` is
    `getDirtyOptionMap()[m_hash] = this`. `operator[]` links a node holding a value-initialized
    `nullptr` before `this` is stored in it.
- **Who wrote it without the lock.** `remixapi_SetConfigVariable` (`rtx_remix_api.cpp:1776`) calls
  `readOption` (`rtx_option.cpp:448`) holding only the API's `s_mutex`. `readOption` inserts into
  the option's layer values and calls `markDirty()`, while the render thread's `applyPendingValues`
  walks the map under the update mutex.
  - The companion's sky calls `RemixConfig.SetConfigVariable` every `nativeloader_sky_interval`
    (0.02 s by default, `nativeloader_sky.lua:27`) for each changed sun, moon and star value (lines
    453-461).
  - The fixes' binary logs nothing per call: the crashed session's console has no such line.
- **Threads.**
  - The Remix menu draws on the game's thread: `ImGUI::render` is called from
    `D3D9SwapChainEx::PresentImage` (`d3d9_swapchain.cpp:1297`), inside `Present`.
  - Graph components (`RtxOptionLayerAction`, the only runtime caller of
    `acquireLayer`/`releaseLayer`) initialize, update and clean up on the render thread:
    `SceneManager` -> `m_graphManager.update(ctx)` (`rtx_scene_manager.cpp:707`). No mod in the RTX
    package has graph prims.
  - onChange callbacks run on the render thread after `applyPendingValues` has released the update
    mutex.
- **Reproduced.** A unit test that calls `readOption` on one thread while another loops
  `applyPendingValues` crashes the 0028 code within 1.3-2.1 s (3 of 3 runs). A crash caught by
  attaching a debug loop is the field crash: an access violation reading `0x50` at
  `resolveValue+0x3e` (`rtx_option.cpp:1151`), with `rcx=rbx=rsi=rdi=rbp=r8=0` and `rdx=r14=0x58`.
- **Reproduced in the game** (PoC, gm_construct, R13's settings; `out/r13-d` in the
  `r13-option-lock` worktree). On the published runtime (`91f0696c`), Lua's
  `RemixConfig.SetConfigVariable` at 250 calls per Think plus 250 in each of two render hooks, frame
  rate uncapped, crashed it within 10 s with the field signature:
  - `d3d9.dll+0x1b7dfe` = `resolveValue+0x3e`, reading `0x50`;
  - `applyPendingValues+0x2b9` on the stack.

  The same writes at the 60 fps cap from Think alone (3.3 million in 220 s) did not crash it.
  Capped, the game's thread mostly sleeps while the render thread ends the frame, so the two seldom
  overlap. Patch 0029 took the uncapped load: 21 million writes in 220 s, normal quit.
- **Lost writes.** `applyPendingValues` released the update mutex between passes even with no
  callback to run, and its final "Don't let dirty options persist across frames" clear came after
  another release. A burst of writes from another thread could keep it going to `maxResolves` (4),
  and the clear then dropped the newest marks. The write took effect only when the option was marked
  again. The test caught it in round 313 and round 208 of 500 with only the locks fixed.
- **The minidump holds no heap.** R13's Sentry dump has only thread stacks: `d3d9.dll`'s data and
  the heap are not in it, so the dirty map's nodes could not be read. `out/r13/verify/dirty_map.py`
  (what the registers point at), `symaddr.py` (a function's RVA from a PDB) and `catch_crash.py` (a
  Win32 debug loop that catches a test's first access violation, launching or attaching) are with
  R13's tools in the main checkout.

## R13-P: how a streamed replacement texture reaches its mips (2026-11-03, Claude)

Runtime source `out/worktrees/r12-vram/out/runtime-src` at `403b2336`; the A/B and its evidence are in
the [R13-P report](handover/R13-P-report.md).

- **A material's sampler-feedback stamp is its first replaced texture**, in the order albedo,
  roughness, metallic, secondary, normal, tangent, height, emissive (`trackTexture`,
  `rtx_scene_manager.cpp:1824-1841`, called at `:2215-2229`). The others are associated with it, at most
  8 per stamp. A material that keeps the game's albedo (ToPBR's game maps, 54 of `ai_pbr`'s 219
  materials) still gets feedback through its roughness, metallic or normal map.
- **Feedback** is written only in the primary and PSR passes (`RAY_TRACING_PRIMARY_RAY`,
  `opaque_surface_material_interaction.slangh:727-740`). It is the mip level a pixel needs, measured
  against a fixed 4096 texture (`:443-455`), kept with an atomic minimum per stamp. The host reads the
  previous frame's copy (`rtx_texture_manager.cpp:1448-1474`) and turns it into a count of mips: the
  owner's mip count minus that level, given to the associated textures too (`:1500-1561`). An owner
  smaller than 4096 therefore asks one level too few per halving. The largest count seen is kept until
  budget pressure (`:1563-1588`).
- **An undrawn streamed texture drops to its tail at once**: `garbageCollection` requests 0 mips for a
  demotable texture no instance holds (`:1676-1682`), and the DDS loaders keep a five-mip tail
  (`kMipLevelsToCache`, `rtx_asset_data_manager.cpp:35`, `:354`). Removing four characters freed 1.39 GB
  within about 105 ms. Anti-culling keeps the instances of characters the camera turns away from
  (`rtx.antiCulling.object.enable`), so turning away freed nothing.
- **Load path**: one lowest-priority thread memory-maps each DDS, copies the requested mip range into a
  96 MiB staging ring and hands at most 32 textures per frame to the render thread
  (`rtx_texture_manager.cpp:472-706`, `:1051-1085`).
- **Measured on the PoC** (3840x2160, NVMe, warm file cache): a streamed character's first upgrade
  arrived 2-5 frames after it was first drawn, and the last 155-880 ms after it (251-464 MB per
  character). The PoC's three character packs (2.22 GB) preloaded cost 2.23 GB of replacement textures,
  1.64-1.71 GB of driver VRAM and 1.70 GB of private bytes at idle, with an unchanged working set.
- **Mod precedence for a material defined twice**: `getReplacementMaterial` returns the first mod's
  (`rtx_asset_replacer.cpp:110-121`), and mods sort by fallback priority, then path
  (`rtx_mod_manager.h:130-140`). In the field `ai_pbr` therefore wins over the `pbr_*` packs, whose
  copies of the same files are preloaded anyway.

## R13 integration: per-profile memory, an option crash, Steam Cloud (2026-11-03, Claude)

- **Per-profile memory with the final package** (PoC, 1920x1080, gm_construct, the copied field
  library of 98 saved NPC/player rigs, no Workshop add-ons; `remix.memory_profile` set on the 32 GB
  card; `out/r13/int/final-*` in the `r13-int` worktree). Private / working set / driver VRAM:

  | Profile | Idle | Four characters spawned | Peak |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | minimum (low tier) | 9.2 / 3.5 / 5.6 GB | 12.8 / 4.9 / 7.7 GB | 12.8 / 5.0 / 7.7 GB |
  | recommended (medium tier) | 11.7 / 5.7 / 5.8 GB | 15.3 / 7.2 / 7.9 GB | 15.7 / 7.2 / 8.3 GB |
  | high (auto) | 15.1 / 9.1 / 5.9 GB | 18.8 / 10.6 / 8.0 GB | 22.5 / 10.7 / 11.6 GB |

  The PoC's own Remix mods preload 2.5-2.7 GB of replacement textures in every profile. A plain
  Combine soldier after the four were removed raised game textures 2.44 -> 2.66 GB (minimum), 2.49 ->
  3.07 GB (recommended) and 2.49 -> 6.36 GB (high); only the minimum exceeded its budget (2 GiB) and
  came back under it: 2,770 CPU copies and 48 images released, 42 re-uploads on later use
  (`[RTX Managed Textures]` lines).
- **First spawns from the NPC tab:** 阮·梅 R18 (about 1.2 GB of game textures) 4.0 s when ready
  (recommended, high), 6.0 s cold (minimum); other characters 0.5-2.1 s; a loaded character again
  0.04-0.07 s.
- **An intermittent crash in Remix's option system.** One recommended/medium session (runtime
  `0c20772f`) ended about 15 s into idle with an access violation reading 0x50 on the render thread:
  `RtxOptionImpl::resolveValue+0x3e` (`rtx_option.cpp:1151`) <- `updateResolvedValue` <-
  `RtxOptionManager::applyPendingValues+0x2b9` (`rtx_option_manager.cpp:196`, iterating the dirty
  option map under `getUpdateMutex()`) <- `RtxContext::injectRTX+0x2729` (a heuristic stack from the
  Sentry minidump, symbolized with dbghelp against the build's PDB). The main thread was waiting on the
  same mutex. The repeat and seven other sessions ran cleanly. Candidate (R13-B, unproven):
  `acquireLayer`/`releaseLayer` change every option's layer list under the layer mutex only. Tools:
  `out/r13/verify/read_dump.py`, `stack_scan.py`, `threads_scan.py`, `symbolize.py` in the main
  checkout; the Python `minidump` package reads the dump.
- **Steam Cloud carries a PoC session's settings to the field game** (R13-A found it): GMod reads
  `Steam\userdata\<account>\4000\remote\cfg\config.cfg` at start and writes it at its quit, one copy
  for every install. After R13-B's sessions with `+fps_max 60` the cloud copy differed from the
  field's `config.cfg` only in `fps_max` (60 against 300). After sessions that execute the field's
  `config.cfg` and `host_writeconfig` before the quit (now every `poc_session.py` run), the two were
  byte-identical (`0ebf6a15`).
- **The field game after R13** (loader 0.13.0, high profile, gm_construct, 3840x2160, 767 Workshop
  subscriptions; `out/r13/field/05-r13-steady`, main checkout): working set 10.86 GB idle and 11.17 GB
  with two characters (R12 baseline 17.98 and 18.47 GB); private bytes 27.23 GB idle (28.70 GB);
  the Combine trigger +5.43 GB of game textures, driver 22.4 of 32.95 GB. Replacement textures
  10.27 GB (R12 baseline session 4.05 GB; the user's R12 session in the lag report 10.3 GB). They are
  the user's preloading mods: the field's mods preload 11.05 GB of files (R13-B), ToPBR's published
  `~gmod_topbr` references 1.22 GB of game maps (8 preloading materials), and on the PoC the R12 and
  R13 runtimes hold the same replacement textures for the same content (2.68 GB idle). Private bytes
  count the VRAM the driver maps into the process, so the working set is the RAM measure here.

## R13-B: where the runtime's host memory goes, and the texture budget (2026-11-03)

Read from the runtime fork at `fc62f44f` (patches 0001-0022) and measured on this machine (RTX 5090,
driver Vulkan memory: heap 0 device-local with type 1 `DEVICE_LOCAL` and type 4
`DEVICE_LOCAL|HOST_VISIBLE|HOST_COHERENT` (resizable BAR); heap 1 system with type 2
`HOST_VISIBLE|HOST_COHERENT` and type 3 `HOST_VISIBLE|HOST_COHERENT|HOST_CACHED`).

- **Chunks.** DXVK sub-allocates device-local memory in 320 MiB chunks and every other type in
  128 MiB chunks (`dxvk.deviceLocalMemoryChunkSizeMB` / `dxvk.otherMemoryChunkSizeMB`,
  `dxvk_options.cpp:64-65`; `pickChunkSize`, `dxvk_memory.cpp:722-748`); a request of a chunk's size or
  more, or one the driver prefers dedicated, gets its own memory object (`tryAllocFromType`,
  `:555-568`). Host-visible memory objects are mapped for their whole life (`tryAllocDeviceMemory`,
  `:653-661`).
- **Texture CPU copies.** Every managed-pool texture keeps one buffer per mip in
  `HOST_VISIBLE|HOST_COHERENT|HOST_CACHED` memory (`D3D9CommonTexture::CreateBufferSubresource`,
  `d3d9_common_texture.cpp:214-240`): type 3, mapped read-write. A 4096-square A8R8G8B8 mip 0 (64 MiB)
  shares a 128 MiB chunk; an 8192-square one (256 MiB) or the 11059x8847 one (391 MB) is a dedicated
  allocation, the 268.4 MB and 391.4 MB blocks of the field's idle census.
- **Write-combined private memory is mostly VRAM.** The NVIDIA driver maps the process's device-local
  allocations into its address space as committed `PAGE_READWRITE|PAGE_WRITECOMBINE` private memory, and
  they count in its private bytes (commit). The GPU probe's census: 2.03 GB write-combined committed, of
  which DXVK's own mappings (type 2 staging chunks and the type 4 chunk) were 0.60 GB; releasing four
  89.5 MB images (358 MB) lowered write-combined commit and private bytes by 358 MB while read-write was
  unchanged. Releasing their CPU copies lowered read-write commit by 402 MB. So the field's 11.0 GB of
  write-combined memory is the game's VRAM in use plus DXVK's staging, and it holds system commit.
- **The replacement texture budget** (`calcTextureMemoryBudget_Megabytes`,
  `rtx_texture_manager.cpp:1817-1873`) is `rtx.texturemanager.budgetPercentageOfAvailableVram` (50 %) of
  the free VRAM plus what replacement textures hold, the free VRAM being the device-local heap's driver
  budget minus the process's usage (less DXVK's free chunk space), or `fixedBudgetMiB` when
  `fixedBudgetEnable`; a 2 GiB reserve applies before Remix's resources exist. It is recomputed in every
  ray-traced frame's garbage collection (`garbageCollection`, `:1563-1648`), so it follows the driver's
  live budget. Textures bound to instances are kept at the mip count sampler feedback asked for, best
  first, while they fit; the rest are demoted to their 5-mip tail (`kMipLevelsToCache`,
  `rtx_asset_data_manager.cpp:35`; `requestMips` clamps to at least one mip, `rtx_texture.cpp:189-198`).
  Unbound ones stay at the tail. Textures too large for the 96 MiB staging ring, sky textures and
  USD materials with `preloadTextures` are never demoted. The Remix menu's "Texture Streaming" section
  sets a fixed budget up to 32 GB or the percentage from 10 to 100 % (`dxvk_imgui.cpp:4869-4912`),
  saved in `user.conf`: a fixed budget does not follow the driver at all.
- **Preloaded replacement textures are pinned for the session.** A USD shader's
  `inputs:preload_textures` makes `preloadTextureAsset` create the texture with `m_canDemote = false` and
  every mip requested (`rtx_mod_usd.cpp:677`, `:731-757`; `rtx_texture_manager.cpp` `preloadTextureAsset`);
  `requestMips` then forces every mip (`rtx_texture.cpp:188-197`), and both lists of the budget pass and
  `manageBudgetWithPriority` take only `m_canDemote` textures. The texture is created when the mod loads,
  before anything is drawn, and `m_assetHashToTextures` and the sampler-feedback table keep it for the
  session, also after a USD reload leaves no material referencing it. Only the explicit purge
  (`requestTextureVramFree`, the fixes' `rtx_flush_textures` and their map-exit purge) drops its image,
  and it comes back only when drawn. Remix keys replacement textures by file path
  (`rtx_asset_data_manager.cpp:85`), so the same file under two mods is loaded twice. Who sets the flag:
  rpai on every material (`skills/mmd-remix-pbr/tool/rpai/usda.py:61`), the material editor by default
  (`sh_36_rtx_schema.lua:159`), the fixes' ToPBR for game maps (R13-M), `gm_poolrooms_rtx`, `rtx_water`,
  `blood_overhaul_rtx`.
- **"Drawn" for a replacement texture** is its `m_refCount`: every texture index of a bound material is
  retained by the instance (`SceneManager::retainSurfaceMaterial`, `rtx_scene_manager.cpp:1720-1754`)
  and released when it goes, and Remix destroys an instance one frame after its last draw
  (`rtx.numFramesToKeepInstances` = 1, `rtx_options.h:698`). The non-sampler-feedback list already uses
  it: unbound demotable textures drop to their smallest mip (`garbageCollection`).
- **Preloads measured** (`out/r13-b/preload_survey.py`, read-only): the field's mods preload 889 files,
  11,048,853,372 bytes (`ai_pbr` 8,496,386,704 in 219 shaders; `pbr_evernight_march7th`,
  `pbr_guinaifen`, `pbr_robin` 2,220,023,384 bytes with the same file names and sizes as `ai_pbr`'s
  folders for those characters; `blood_overhaul_rtx` 171,647,308; `gm_poolrooms_rtx` 149,599,544;
  `rtx_water` 11,196,432). The lag report's replacement textures were 10,320 MiB, the files 10,537 MiB.
  The PoC's mods preload 170 files, 2,380,819,360 bytes; its census at idle on gm_construct, with no
  character spawned, held 2,425,102,336 bytes of material textures in 691 images.
- **The lag trigger in numbers** (PoC, copied field library, 1920x1080, `out/worktrees/r13-runtime/out/r13-b`):
  a plain Combine soldier raised game textures 0.96 -> 17.08 GB and private bytes 28.27 -> 43.69 GB on
  the original runtime, which kept them (`b3-orig-1080`). Patch 0027's counters: all 1,128 new images
  came from the draw path (`UploadManagedTextures` from `PrepareTextures`), none from `PreLoad`, a
  sampling view, a flushed upload or mip generation; the same draw burst (1,064 images, 16.91 GB)
  happens once while the map loads, before Source destroys those textures and loads them again (the
  start-up peak of 40.7 GB private bytes). The burst raised write-combined commit by 15.36 GB.
- **The review's defects, reproduced** (GPU probe, `out/worktrees/r13-runtime/out/r13-b/probe-pre0028`,
  runtime `0c20772f` with patches 0023-0027): with a 1 MiB budget a second thread reading
  `dxvk_GetTextureHash` while images were released got wrong hashes (`ReleaseManagedImage` moved the image
  out before it wrote the released hash, `d3d9_device.cpp`); with CPU copies released a
  `D3DLOCK_NO_DIRTY_UPDATE` write was lost after idle passes (`FlushImage` uploads only the dirty box,
  and `ReleaseIdleHostCopies` checked only `NeedsAnyUpload`). Patch 0028 passes both, about 1.2 billion
  hash reads per run without a wrong one (`probe-0028`).
- **The terrain baker does not retain what it samples:** it tracks its source textures through
  `SceneManager::trackTexture` every frame it bakes (`rtx_terrain_baker.cpp:144-178`), so their
  instance reference count stays 0, and the baked instance binds the baker's own material
  (`rtx_context.cpp:2868-2875`). `RtxTextureManager::addTexture` is the one path every consumer takes.
- **An intermittent option crash** (an access violation reading 0x50 in `RtxOptionImpl::resolveValue`,
  `rtx_option.cpp:1151`, under `applyPendingValues`; one integrated PoC session, not reproduced): the
  dirty-option loop of `RtxOptionManager::applyPendingValues` holds only the update mutex, while
  `acquireLayer` and `releaseLayer` (`rtx_option_manager.cpp`) hold only `s_layerMutex` as they insert into
  and erase from every option's layer queue (`readOptionLayer`, `disableLayerValue`) and call
  `markDirty()`, which writes the dirty map without a lock (`rtx_option.cpp:355-357`). A layer acquired or
  released on another thread during that loop (the graph's option layer actions,
  `graph/components/rtx_option_layer_action.h:104-127`) would corrupt the queue `resolveValue` iterates.
  A candidate, not proven: the dump showed no such thread at the crash.
- **WDDM and a VRAM hog:** with 25.8 GB of render targets held (and cleared twice a second) by another
  process, the foreground game's `VK_EXT_memory_budget` budget fell from 32.95 only to 26.15 GB, its own
  usage at the time (26.14 GB); the hog's budget fell to 6.9 GB and its memory was paged. A background
  process does not create real pressure for the game on this computer.
- **DXVK chunk space after a release:** after the minimum profile released 14.7 GB of the burst's
  images, the device-local chunks held 9.14 GB with 5.32 GB used (a chunk is freed only when empty), so
  the driver's usage stayed 3.7 GB above its level before the burst; releasing the large dedicated
  images instead (the default budget) stranded nothing.
- **Remix holds game textures** in its texture cache (one slot per image view) until the scene is cleared
  (a map change or an explicit cleanup) or the D3D9 texture is destroyed
  (`releaseApplicationReleasedTextures`, `rtx_texture_manager.cpp:1191-1217`, frees an
  application-released image's slot once no bound instance samples it; no other path frees a game
  texture's slot). An image drawn once therefore stayed referenced until the next map even if Source
  never drew it again; R13-B's release marks the image application-released for that reason.

## R13-M: compact imported game maps and reuse across versions (2026-11-03, Claude)

- **What Remix samples from each map.** Roughness and metallic read only `.x` and the octahedral
  normal only `.xy` (runtime fork `src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/concept/surface_material/opaque_surface_material_interaction.slangh:863`,
  `:908`, `:927`), so BC4 (one channel) and BC5 (two) carry everything the uncompressed maps did.
  The fixes' octahedral encoder writes B = 0 and A = 255 (`source/material_pipeline/to_pbr/vtf.cpp:253-256`).
- **Remix's DDS reader.** `rtx_asset_data_manager.cpp:123-194` parses DX10 headers through gli's
  format table, sizes each level in whole blocks (`max(1, ceil(w/4)) * max(1, ceil(h/4)) * block`),
  needs `DDSD_MIPMAPCOUNT` for more than one level and holds at most 16 levels. It maps a DDS with
  `FILE_SHARE_READ` only (`:286-295`): while Remix streams a file, nothing can replace, rename or
  delete it, so migrated maps are written under new names.
- **Sizes, 2048x2048 with a full chain:** uncompressed 22,369,748 bytes, BC5 5,592,580, BC4
  2,796,364. A family was normal + roughness + metallic + AO = 89,478,992 bytes on disk, of which
  Remix loaded 67,109,244; now 11,185,308 for both. Emission (22,369,748) is unchanged.
- **The field cache (read only, 2026-11-03):** `rtx-remix/mods/~gmod_topbr/textures` holds 384 files,
  4,567,891,854 bytes; 301 are imported game files (4,425,021,500 bytes of DDS). 58 families are
  finished (27 `r11-game-v5`, 31 `r12-game-v7`); `game_991AF3B052DC62B2` stopped after its metallic
  map (no marker), as the bug report found. 49 AO maps hold 886,402,452 bytes that nothing reads.
  17 families (29%) have an emission map, 308,982,548 bytes; half of those maps light at most 1.1% of
  their texels (median lit fraction 0.01091, `out/r13-m/emission-field.json` in the R13-M worktree).
- **The shipped key formulas check out against real data.** For all 12 converted families of 洛茜,
  阿芙2.0 and endminf, the v7 formula (and for endminf's three families also v5) finds the field's
  finished family; every stored base level equals today's conversion of the same inputs, and the
  R13-M uncompressed writer reproduces those files byte for byte (`game_dds_probe`, `out/r13-m/probe-field-2.log`).
  v5 keys hash the present maps without role tags or layout, so the same bytes can belong to a
  different layout: v5 chose Silver for every family in a folder holding any `*_MRA` file.
- **BC4 encoder quality on real maps** (field files, 1,500-20,000 sampled blocks, 8-bit RMS):
  min/max endpoints give normal maps 4.44/2.79/3.28; with least squares 3.96/2.44/2.96; the
  exhaustive optimum is 3.50/2.13/2.63, and restricting it to the per-texel bound changes it by
  under 0.02. Quantized roughness is the outlier: least squares 1.12, optimum 0.54, because its few
  levels lie on a palette whose endpoint extends past the data (for example {65, 118, 170} on
  r0 = 249, r1 = 65). Aligning the block's minimum and maximum to two palette positions for blocks of
  at most four levels reaches 0.53 at about 1.7 us per block; on normal maps it would cost 5x for 1%.
- **Real maps after R13-M** (`game_dds_probe`, three characters, 12 families, every block within
  (max - min) / 14): normal RMS 0.27-3.30, roughness 0.12-1.20, metallic 0-1.18 (8-bit units);
  conversion with encoding 0.44-2.90 s per family. Disk 945,122,708 -> 145,408,760 bytes; what Remix
  loads 732,609,912 -> 145,408,760 bytes.
- **Remix debug views for these maps** (`src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/utility/debug_view_indices.h`):
  25 roughness, 16 shading normal, 94 primary base reflectivity (raw; metals show their albedo),
  set with `RemixConfig.SetConfigVariable("rtx.debugView.debugViewIdx", n)`.
- **PoC, the same three characters (high tier, 1280x720, gm_flatgrass; `out/r13-m/poc`):** spawning them
  with the shipped uncompressed maps raised Remix's replacement-texture bytes (`usedMaterialTextureBytes`)
  by 732,669,952, within 60 KB of the files' sum; with R13-M's compact maps by 139,901,952 (the
  compact files new to that session, predicted 139,816,228).
- **Remix preloads a previous session's game maps at startup.** Game-map materials carry
  `preload_textures = 1` (`usda.cpp:350-357`, so generated normals do not stay at their smallest mip).
  Before any character was drawn, the session after the uncompressed run already held 705,814,528
  more replacement bytes than a clean start (the published normal/roughness/metallic maps; emission
  loads when drawn), and still held them after ToPBR replaced the USD and its characters used new
  files. After a compact run the startup surplus was 118,640,640 bytes. So every map of every
  character the last session published is resident from the next start until the game exits.

## R13-A: what loads a saved character, and when (2026-11-03, Claude)

- **Map start loaded every saved character.** `sharing.lua`'s `InitPostEntity` registered each
  approved citizen/combine/player rig through `ReadyActor` (`actors.lua:88-103` before R13-A):
  mount the material archive and carrier, then `util.PrecacheModel` and `util.IsValidModel` on the
  server. Precaching loads the model, its materials and its textures. On the copied field library
  (57 characters; 98 loadable saved NPC/player rigs of generator 30-31 across 55 characters; 20.5 GB
  of material archives) the PoC at 1920x1080 held, with nothing spawned: private bytes 27.0 GB,
  working set 20.9 GB, game textures on the GPU 0.29 GB (patch 0022 defers their GPU images).
- **Carrier spawn icons are empty.** A carrier has no visible mesh: every engine spawn icon of a
  hotloader carrier in the field's `materials/spawnicons/models/mmd/<16 hex>/` is a 215-byte PNG. The
  PoC's Player Model window drew one for each of 7 saved player models (it writes them to
  `garrysmod/materials/spawnicons`), loading each model to do so.
- **Sandbox precaches before `SetModel`.** The base player class runs `util.PrecacheModel(modelname)`
  then `self.Player:SetModel(modelname)` (`gamemodes/base/gamemode/player_class/player_default.lua:71-72`);
  `InternalSpawnNPC` sets an NPC-list entry's model before `Spawn` (`sandbox/gamemode/commands.lua:481-485`).
- **The native module's name records date the last use.** `registerShortName` rewrites
  `names/<kind>/<short>.json` on every call (`native/assets.cpp:132-137`): `PrepareCarrier` (cached or
  packaged, `module.cpp:482`, `rig.cpp:487`) rewrites `names/rigs/<key>.json`, `loadAsset` /
  `prepareSourceMaterials` rewrite `names/assets/<id>.json` (`assets.cpp:217-220`, `:472`). A map start
  also rewrites `approved.json` (`sharing.lua`'s `ForgetPublishedAssets`, even with nothing missing),
  and so does a hotloader spawn that publishes a new entry (`PublishActor` → `PublishRig`). The
  field's writes of `names/assets` (02:41:07, 02:41:10) and `approved.json` (02:41:16) before the lag
  report's jump are what the PoC's hotloader spawn as a Combine soldier wrote (run 09).
- **The lag trigger: the first Combine soldier makes every loaded texture GPU-resident.** On the
  current package with the copied library (every saved character precached, game textures 0.29 GB),
  a stock `gmod_spawnnpc npc_combine_s` raised game textures to 17.07 GB and private bytes from 26.96
  to 43.31 GB between two frames 1.4 s after the command, with no hotloader call in between (R13-A
  run 19, per-frame trace on `SysTime()`). A character spawned as a Combine soldier from the hotloader
  does the same (run 09: 1.54 → 17.12 GB). With only the ready set loaded (R13-A, high profile, 10
  characters with 4.8 GiB of archives) the same soldier raised them 0.30 → 5.32 GB (run 20). None of
  these raised game textures: the catalog broadcast, the hotloader window's preview, the NPC tab, the
  Player Model window, NPC-tab and player-model spawns, a manhack attacking for 25 s, an archive
  mount, a ragdoll new fit, a citizen new fit, a map change, a reload of the map,
  `mat_reloadallmaterials`, `mat_reloadtextures` (runs 08, 09, 13, 19, 20). No packaged Lua names
  Combine soldiers or reacts to one in a way that loads materials.
- **The part of the Combine soldier that does it is `item_ammo_ar2_altfire`.** Every
  `npc_combine_s` precaches that item with `item_healthvial` and `weapon_frag`. Spawned one at a time
  on the current package (R13-A run 21), a Metro Police officer, a citizen with an AR2, a frag
  grenade and a health vial left game textures at 0.29 GB; the AR2's alt-fire ammo item raised them to
  17.07 GB (private 26.89 → 43.44 GB) within two seconds. A soldier that never dropped one did it
  too (run 19), so its precache does, not a draw. The item's precache loads its model
  `models/items/combine_rifle_ammo01.mdl` and, as recalled from the Source SDK 2013 code (not
  checked here), the `combineball` particle system; `mmd_lazy_session.py --sequence ammo` splits them.
- **GMod keeps `cfg/config.cfg` in Steam Cloud.** A game takes
  `Steam\userdata\<account>\4000\remote\cfg\config.cfg` at start (the PoC's local `config.cfg` was
  rewritten with the cloud copy seconds after a launch) and writes its settings back at its quit, so
  a PoC session's last settings reach the field game at its next start. After R13-A runs 08-13 the
  cloud held `cl_playermodel "kleiner"` (the measure sequence's reset) and `fps_max "60"`
  (`mmd_reimport_session.py` sends it), against the field's own `"Bai Mei"` and `300`; a player
  model chosen in run 08 was the player's model at the start of runs 10 and 11 although each run
  restored the PoC's local `config.cfg`. Executing the field's `config.cfg` and `host_writeconfig`
  before the quit leaves the cloud copy byte-identical to the field's (R13-A runs 09 onwards).
- **The native module needs `textures/<sha256>.png`.** `loadAsset` reads an asset's PNG textures to
  build it for spawning and presentation; the main session's field-cache copy has none, so a spawn
  failed with `Cannot read ...textures\<hash>.png` until the 546 PNGs its manifests name (1.35 GB)
  were added to the test copy. The native module keeps at most 8 loaded assets (`module.cpp:240`).
- **The game cuts a printed line at about 4 KB** (a 4,011-character `R13A_ENTRIES` line was cut);
  probes print one JSON object per line.
- **Intermittent PoC start crash:** two of the first eight launches (runs 03 and 06, each within a
  minute of another game's exit) stopped at the main menu with `0xC0000005` in
  `nvoglv64.dll+0xe622f8` (reading address 0 / 0xffffffffffffffff), as R12-C's `07` control
  (`+0xe6230a`). With a 45 s pause before launching, none of the later launches crashed; no hotloader
  code had run.
- **What a used character keeps after removal.** Source keeps its model, materials and textures until
  the map changes (no unprecache). The fixes' `rtx_flush_textures` (`UncacheAllMaterials`, then a
  renderer purge) released 2.2 GB of game textures and 20 GB of private bytes in the current package
  (run 12); with R13-A it released the CPU copies (private 19.74 → 14.79 GB) while 2.5 GB of game
  textures stayed until the map changed (run 16). The next map loads none of them unless they are in
  the ready set.

## R12-A: retained carrier archive versus metadata (2026-11-03)

- PoC copy of the user's Endministrator imports as `a9c7045d38634d1d0469733b152022f5a6d47a161dffafbf0c8688d0ffd23ab3`.
  A saved NPC carrier `5dba2333854dc362c0fc5f85f3fced0d`, deleted/reimported before its first spawn
  in that session, reproduces the exact carrier-outdated message (`out/r12-a/baseline-cold/console-after.log:692`).
  Source still reports a valid model, but `rig.json` is absent and the client instance is 0. A warm
  server cache masks that error while the client remains broken. Final PoC QA restores every
  sidecar across nine factory requests and two conversions, with seven retained-entity observations
  unchanged and zero restore/Lua errors (`out/r12-a/qa-summary.json`).

- In the read-only upstream hotloader source, `native/assets.cpp:522` collects a selected asset's
  rig directory and short-name records for deletion. `assets.cpp:529` keeps Windows-locked files
  in `cleanup.json`. `native/module.cpp:482` finds an existing `carrier.gma`, restores its name
  record/retention and returns `rig.manifest`, but does not rewrite `rig.json`; only the packaging
  branch (`native/rig.cpp:489`) writes that sidecar. Native binaries are unchanged in R12-A.
- The shipped model lookup in `packages/model-hotloader/mmd_hotloader/lua/mmdhl/materials.lua`
  originally required the short-name record before checking `mmdhl.rigs`. The persistence wrapper
  (`persistence.lua`, `EnsureModel`/`SetModel`) runs before the factories' attachment step caches
  the newly prepared manifest. R12-A remembers it and repairs only missing metadata before that
  wrapper. Its `MMDHL.AssetForgotten` event evicts per-asset reusable rig/geometry/conversion state;
  live entities retain their own bound manifest. See [ADR 0094](decisions/0094-reimported-carrier-metadata-and-state.md).

## R12-D: manual eye-white identity and a missed Baizhi surface (2026-11-02)

- `companion/nativeloader/lua/autorun/client/nativeloader_eye_whites.lua:65` now restricts discovery
  to existing hotloader entities and already available asset metadata. The public list is
  `packages/model-hotloader/mmd_hotloader/lua/mmdhl/carrier.lua:83`; it includes native actors and
  client ragdolls, while an asset table can outlive its last spawned instance. Library metadata is
  therefore insufficient evidence for a texture lookup. The harness verifies zero Material calls
  and zero writes for unspawned assets, previews and foreign public paths.
- Choices use the complete content ID plus one-based material slot/native name, independently of
  renderer-generated paths (`nativeloader_eye_whites.lua:17`). The setter validates current spawned
  ownership and real generated VMT/VTF inputs, compares the existing DATA bytes before writing, and
  verifies persistence before applying the selection (`nativeloader_eye_whites.lua:342`). False is
  distinct from absent and outranks a positive automatic name (`nativeloader_eye_whites.lua:58`).
- A read-only source from `E:\G\Upload\1_fin\Baizhi\1_PMX\鸣潮_白芷1.12_by_鸣潮_b1b864afc9b3711e895c34a155eb3d84\鸣潮_白莲1.12.pmx`
  was copied with its textures into `out/r12-d/model/baizhi` (30,699,734 bytes). PMX SHA-256 is
  `3b31d7f554d8dbdbb229185ea39db53d213b941e9e6836853a946701287d4ad8`. The shipped worker imports this
  copy as asset `489c095ce90ee2dcfdefa669febcd7ec875ebcec0c865b7164d184e73d921cd8`, 31 materials.
  Slots 10 `bai` and 16 `bai3` both miss automatic names. UV inspection shows `bai` samples pink
  backing from the eye atlas; `bai3` samples the white eye region of the shared face atlas. The
  manual fixture therefore selects only slot 16. Evidence: `out/r12-d/model-copy.json`,
  `status.json`, `model-surfaces.json`, `uv-slot-10.png`, `uv-slot-16.png`.
- The PoC's real API returns **0**, not -1, for `file.Size` on the nonexistent choices file:
  `file.Exists=false`, `file.Read=nil`, while the generated VMT/VTF both exist (VTF 22,369,700 bytes).
  Inferring existence from size originally blocked the first save. The controller now tests existence
  independently before bounded reading; `manual_missing_size_zero` fails before and passes after
  this correction. `out/r12-d/scope-qa2.json` records the actual API result and JSON reload.
- The actual capture helper at `tools/poc_session.py:698` creates `nl_session_close` with repeat
  count **0** (continuous), despite its documentation saying 30 seconds. For UI captures the probe
  explicitly removes that test-only timer; it never changes the product's UI hooks. The first run's
  removed chooser and refused choices are excluded from acceptance.
- The accepted behavior matrix changes only `mmd/489c095ce90ee2dc/bai3_16` out of 31 materials.
  The other 30, including the shared-atlas face surfaces, retain their texture bindings. Unmark/reset
  restore all 31; native JSON reload keeps the explicit true choice. The alias is
  `0x71f624d5c68def10=0x872f42a9c3b2ca2f`. Its single 22,369,700-byte VTF took 1,960.334 ms on first
  preparation and 127.548 ms after controller reload in this run: one-time cold resource work can
  visibly stall, and is not a steady rendering cost or a measured GPU-allocation total. Broader VRAM
  reclamation remains R12-C's work. Evidence: `scope-qa2.json`, `poc/manual-eyes-final/console.log`.

## R12-B2: WIC transparent colour and optional evidence (2026-11-03)

- Review's unchanged `out/r12/wic_alpha_test.exe` reproduces the old production path on the
  copied Body01_B_MRA: source 2048x2048 has 97.7% alpha-zero pixels, mean RGB 167.6 there and
  166.1 overall; WIC Fant at 128x128 has 97.1% alpha zero, mean RGB **0.0** there and **3.1**
  overall. `game_pbr.h:167` now converts the source frame directly to straight RGBA before
  independent integer-area averaging. At 128x128, mean R/G/B is 154.561/113.404/230.281 versus
  source 154.556/113.407/230.278; alpha-zero mean RGB stays 167.34. The real production conversion
  at 128 checks all 16,384 eligible pixels, 15,904 under alpha zero, for exact roughness/metallic/AO.
- `game_matching.inl:120` isolates ambiguous/unreadable families. `:144` prepares core/base
  descriptors before optional data roles; `:238` requires equal nonzero vocabulary groups for
  auxiliary evidence. Self-votes, diffuse variants and conflicting explicit `T_*_D` families
  abstain. Decode, input/pixel/file/depth/family bounds remain. Core resource exhaustion still
  fails closed; optional failure does not fail the folder. Logs include the winning image.
- The same 1,133 folder/base pairs, 121 PMX files and 259 naming references now give **146/0/113**
  agree/disagree/abstain, versus 135/0/124. WuWa is 39/0/36 (+1 agree); Endfield 75/0/53 (+6);
  Silver 32/0/24 (+4). Fourteen new names-visible acceptances were visually reviewed. Six prior
  acceptances now abstain: three explicit-family conflicts, two weak features, one decode-budget
  exhaustion. These are naming-reference comparisons, not independent annotations.
- The measured one-pass 3x3 edge blur increased the trial from 148/0/111 to 167/0/92, but its
  names-visible results included Avywenna's iris matched to body; reject the blur and retain
  unblurred production. Initial broad auxiliary siblings also self-voted diffuse bases and crossed
  EyeTrans/Pupil and Hair_02/Hair_01; final data-role and exported-family guards remove those cases.
- The Alf2 copy's 衣饰→Body01_B uses MRA RGB (.8602 total, .7802 spatial, .7470 margin).
  头发→Hair01_A uses AnisoMaskPS (.5989 total, .5189 spatial, .5212 margin). 熔岩 and 眉毛 abstain.
  The PoC confirms hair and two accessories `automatic`; existing face/eye/skin protection remains.
  Generated PNG fractional/downsample and smaller-normal conversion regressions pass. Evidence:
  `out/r12-b2`, with every new acceptance and all 16 bases in the R12-B report.


## R12-B: features without pairing names (2026-11-02)

- The production `GamePBR::Discover` probe covered **1,133 distinct folder/base pairs** from 121 PMX
  sources under the user's read-only `E:/G/Upload`, including Wuthering Waves, Endfield and Silver
  Palace. Deduplicating repeated model variants avoids counting the same folder/base repeatedly.
  The 259 accepted exact-stem pairs provide a naming reference. With pairing names hidden, **135
  agree, 0 disagree, 124 abstain**. By production layout: WuWa 38/0/37, Endfield 69/0/59, Silver 28/0/28.
  This measures agreement with the existing naming route, not independent human annotations.
- The 阿芙2.0 folder's three PMX files reference 16 distinct bases, including gun/strap/box props
  beyond the 13 character bases. Feature matching accepts clothing → Body01_A (.7301, margin .6686), stockings →
  Socks01_A (.6932, .6362), hat → Hat01_A (.6548, .4170), and an eye-reflection base → Pupil01_A
  (.5208, .3257). The eye atlas remains protected at conversion. Hair and accessories abstain;
  their weak feature evidence is not rescued by vocabulary. The player can explicitly choose them.
- Features are spatial edge correlations from actual production WIC thumbnails, not an image
  classifier. Score thresholds are .28 raw/.36 supported/.12 margin; vocabulary contributes .08.
  Debug base/normal/packed comparisons and complete per-base decisions are under `out/r12-b`.
  Production source is included in the GPL corresponding-source tree's `game_matching.inl`.
- `QueueGameMaterial` now collects frame hashes before `DrawnIdentity` invokes `FindMaterial`.
  Its regression proves the resolver is never called for empty, zero or excessive hashes. This
  removes the specific R11-B eager-load path identified by R12-C; it is not a total VRAM measurement.
  `CollectMaterialFrameHashes` (`to_pbr.cpp:4229`) queries only tracked texture variants;
  `D3D9TextureTracker::GetTextureVariantsForMaterial` (`d3d9_texture_tracker.cpp:446`) performs a
  cache lookup/AddRef without resolving a material, so the ordering does not hide another eager load.
- The exact bundled-path regression (`tools/tests/test_render_guard_addons.py:111`) requires the
  render guard's Lua exemptions to match the indexed inputs. A new standalone panel therefore
  failed the Release gate. The final panel is embedded in the existing ToPBR driver path; the
  exemption table and companion files stay unchanged. The targeted 25-test path suite passes.
- Stock `garrysmod/lua/vgui/dform.lua:30` defines `Clear`; only the sandbox control-panel wrapper
  adds `ClearControls` (`gamemodes/sandbox/gamemode/spawnmenu/controlpanel.lua:19`). The first actual
  console-editor smoke caught this difference. The editor now uses their common `Clear` method;
  its harness deliberately omits `ClearControls`, and polling preserves the base Think handler.
- UI QA must remove `poc_session.py:696`'s `nl_session_close` timer before testing a Derma window
  with `--hide-hud`. The material picker uses `GetEyeTraceNoCursor`: a popup's mouse cursor must
  not redirect the looked-at character selection. The final probe aims the actual player and
  checks its 35 material records, rather than trying to shadow a player method on one entity.

## R12-C: VRAM attribution and Source census (2026-11-03)

- Copied-field-cache controls at 3840×2160/high, gm_construct, no Workshop, stock Kleiner,
  no active imported character and all three suspect helpers disabled: **68** published actor
  registrations use **13,511,942,144** app-texture bytes; the control with an empty copied rig
  approval map uses **1,065,893,888**. Source's `mmd/t/` estimates fall from **12,432,024,184**
  to zero while other Source estimates stay exactly **900,475,060**. The readiness path calls
  `util.PrecacheModel` / `util.IsValidModel` (`actors.lua:87-103`, restored from `sharing.lua:237`).
  These are registered models, not active imported-character entities.
- Runtime patch 0022 preserves those **68** registrations and **49** visible library entries,
  but allocates the unused static managed GPU images only on first GPU use. The same replay
  drops app textures to **908,630,016** bytes: **12,603,312,128 bytes / 11.74 GiB / 93.3%** less.
  Replacement textures (**2,656,725,504**) and Remix targets (**1,333,341,184**) stay exact.
  DXVK used falls **18,094,716,224 → 5,490,795,072**; driver allocation
  **20,776,869,888 → 8,171,347,968**. Source's logical MMD estimates stay unchanged, because
  its CPU objects remain cached. Evidence: `out/r12-vram/{04,05,16}-census.json` and matching
  session/restoration receipts; byte values in these files remain integers or exactly
  representable JSON Lua numbers, not rounded GB values.

- Read-only capture of the active field's existing `garrysmod/data/native-loader/vram.csv` at
  `2026-11-03T01:40:49Z`: DXVK used **22,858,297,408 bytes**, exactly the sum of its eight
  categories. App textures **14,380,545,024**, replacement textures **5,856,326,144**, render
  targets **1,417,882,624**, OMM **603,456,768**, buffers **397,831,744**, acceleration structures
  **153,115,392**, app buffers **49,139,712**, replacement geometry **0**. Allocated
  **24,040,001,024** includes **1,181,703,616** retained allocator bytes; do not add retained to
  used and allocated together. The driver reported **25,935,142,912** allocated and a
  **31,739,682,816** budget. Local evidence: `out/r12-vram/field-active-vram.json`.
- Read-only module inventory binds that session (PID 8488) to the R11-B fixes
  `526a6584...` and runtime `f76c316a...`, the shipped binaries at `2dd3033`; no field module,
  window or setting was changed. The independent WDDM process counters are not the same metric
  as the runtime's allocation accounting (`field-runtime-identity.json`, `field-gpu-processes.json`).
- Header-only inventory selects the highest numbered `materials-v*.gma` per asset, rather than
  adding historical versions: PoC **9 archives / 111 supported RGBA8888 texture variants /
  3,281,798,328 logical texel bytes**; field **146 / 1,244 / 45,853,418,624**. No unsupported
  layouts or conflicting names occurred. Field's **279** 4096-square/13-mip atlases account for
  **24,964,497,036** of those logical bytes, **10** 8192-square/14-mip atlases another
  **3,579,139,400**. These are disk inventory estimates, not residency; all source payloads
  stay byte-identical (`tools/vtf_census.py`, `out/r12-vram/poc-vtfs.json`, `field-vtfs.json`).
- The ordinary MMD alpha classifier used to call `Material` before obtaining draw hashes.
  R12-C's actual-script harness proves that 4,096 cold material records incur no
  VMT/material/tracker loads with the draw gate and that a new draw still becomes classified.
- Stock x64 `shaderapidx9.dll` SHA-256 is
  `7534cd56738f3f729dab0b88fce7f5fa224898fc15c28021762f3352643f8ca9`. REA/Ghidra shipped-artifact
  observations in `out/r12-vram/rea-*.json` validate the six `DebugTextureInfo001` slots at RVAs
  `15490/155f0/17b30/181f0/18a70/1dbc0` (hex). They set byte flags at +9/+10, return the list at
  +16, read **64-bit** byte totals (the older SDK declares int), check freshness and set debug
  rendering. The public list is empty on the tested Remix render path; an empty list is not
  evidence of no loaded textures.
- REA evidence `ev_ab674a6ef1d3ae41042a2c6db8ba073203e8c8febe27e79eb6181000c6a37144`
  observes the stock list builder at RVA `15eb0`: it is conditional on the enable flag and two
  non-null surface fields, walks the existing host registry and writes Name/TexGroup/Size/Format/
  dimensions/bind counts. `Size` is in bytes. Pooled-name lookup (`3d090`, evidence
  `ev_2cf8e0af51b79ff916205119c5020cff7a8fee9d80d981b50dbe9684220dfe95`) takes a read lock;
  format lookup (`35550`, `ev_09a6c4532c96a033cf70155d368e2de18c8d0ec1b377750e865a3ce15eb48d96`)
  reads a static table. These are static observations, not original source or proof of execution.
  The local-only probe's fallback is gated by that file SHA plus all six vtable RVAs, reads only
  its own registry and rejects read failures, cycles and a changed head/frame. Back/depth-buffer
  entries added separately by the public list are excluded; runtime allocation rows still cover
  them. Unsupported engine builds do not use private offsets.

## R11-B review: damaged registries and durable saves (2026-11-02)

- In the GPL source, `game_registry.h:98` resets load state; only a file over `MaxBytes` or an exact
  `TOPBR_GAME_REGISTRY <digits>` header whose numeric version differs from 1 disables writes. Decimal
  classification handles arbitrarily long versions without overflow. Empty/garbage headers, duplicate
  identities and excess rows discard all records, preserving writability and the original bytes until
  the next backed-up save. Invalid individual records still prune as before.
- `game_registry.h:181` writes staging bytes with `CreateFileW`/`WriteFile`, calls `FlushFileBuffers`,
  closes the handle and uses the existing write-through `MoveFileExW`. A sharing-violation regression
  confirms the old registry survives and the staging file is removed. `to_pbr.cpp:4708` centralizes
  save warnings behind a session member that survives worker restarts; damaged-load logging is separate.
- The production regression verifies seven damaged-header/duplicate/row-bound fixtures, exact `.bak`
  bytes, fresh reload/record/restore, four other-version decimal forms and byte-identical oversized
  input. Review build/test/render evidence remains under `out/r11-b/review`.
- The gate at 22:49:33 UTC found no remaining field process, as did setup/launch checks. The reviewed
  shipped DLL (5,147,136 bytes, `c5ae890e...`) restores the seven Alf records with zero conversions in
  `08-review-missing`; 7/0/7 on/off/restored, zero after cleanup, normal exit 0 and no Lua errors/device
  loss. Exact camera/actor bounds, hashes, USD and registry match the prior low-profile run. All 189
  snapshots and the original Workshop package are restored offline; the verifier's only drift is the
  generated `materials.usda`, matching the original empty-registration snapshot. Depot check: 2,877
  OK files, zero mismatches. The PoC lock is released; no field process or source folder was changed.

## R11-B: persistent imported game maps (2026-11-02)

- A hotloader material name identifies a model/slot; its actual base texture has the separate
  content identity `mmd/t/<16 hex>`. The client now snapshots that live texture name and current
  hashes (`packages/fixes/licenses/oversized-skinning/autopbr/source/material_pipeline/to_pbr/to_pbr.cpp:4507`),
  never a stored material name or old USD hash. Alf's 17 public parts include face/eye parts and
  debug-white parts; seven distinct supported texture identities are visible in the fixed front view.
- `game_registry.h:96` bounds and reads the registry; `:129` preserves edited bytes and replaces it
  atomically; `:175` resolves only known live identities. Four published channels retain their DDS
  byte counts and streaming FNV-1a digests. A valid header alone does not detect same-size pixel edits;
  the production regression explicitly rejects such an edited DDS. Minimum record version 1 is
  independent of generator version 5; the test retains source-less generator provenance, replaces it
  on successful conversion, and rejects retired record version 0. AO is not a material input and is
  not a restoration dependency.
- Source availability is checked on the worker (`to_pbr.cpp:4750`). A readable source with base
  metadata calls the current converter; a missing source uses the validated record. The worker owns
  file I/O and the registry; client work adds no filesystem probes. `rtx_topbr_clear` retains the
  records/DDS and resets both native and Lua submission tracking. `FallbackGuard::Select`, used at
  `to_pbr.cpp:4622`, handles settings and authored exclusion for both paths. Runtime patch 0020
  supplies the unconditional precedence required by ADR 0092; this change leaves it intact.
- The QA character is a read-only copy of `E:/G/Upload/Alf`: 532 files, 3,562,938,076 bytes under
  this worktree's `out/r11-b/source/Alf`. The unindexed candidate package permits testing before
  the one final DLL import. The first exploratory high-profile run reached all expected material
  states, but device loss followed the final camera return (9.04 GB reported budget with another
  field session running); it is diagnostic evidence, not successful acceptance. The cached medium
  run later also lost the device with 8.65 GB budget / 7.86 GB usage and micromap denials. Final
  pinned comparison uses the existing low PoC profile and a 30 fps cap. Source run `04-low-source`
  quits normally with zero Lua errors, seven materials on/restored and zero off.
- The final `04-low-source` / `05-low-missing` pair has identical actor/camera bounds, USD (6,574
  bytes, SHA-256 `97a0f545...`) and registry (1,879 bytes, `615a9d85...`), and 7/0/7 on/off/restored
  hashes in both sessions. Missing source: zero conversions, seven cached restores. Both quit normally
  with zero Lua errors. Character ROI byte-RGB MAE: source/missing on-off 3.669/4.162, on repeats
  1.152/1.168, cross-session on 1.799 and restored 1.332; temporal/exposure drift remains visible.
  Only the checked copy under `out` was renamed; the user's source was never changed. Final indexed
  package and restored-Workshop smokes pass; original config/metadata bytes match, active generated
  materials are zero, and depot verification finds zero mismatches. See [the report](handover/R11-B-report.md).
- Hotloader manifests (`data/mmd_hotloader/assets/<id>/manifest.json`, version 2): `sourceHash` is the
  SHA-256 of the PMX bytes (checked on three field entries whose source exists), so a moved PMX can be
  found by content; `textures[i].base` (64 hex) is **not** the SHA-256 of the image file next to the PMX
  (checked on `tex\颜.png`), so images cannot be matched that way. In the field library (2026-11-02),
  20 of 45 recorded sources are missing; 7 of those exist byte for byte elsewhere under `E:\G\Upload`,
  none of them the five game-PBR characters, whose `Desktop` folders were gone before R11 shipped.

## R10-E: imported eye-white surfaces (2026-11-02)

Final GPU evidence is in the [R10-E report](handover/R10-E-report.md): the automatic 100% ratio is
0.738–1.017 over six conditions, versus 0.921–1.274 for Robin in the same front-view protocol; exact
local parity is not achieved by C-16's frame-average input. Three visible Linlongs measure median
12.209 ms off / 12.202 ms on, with one 22,369,700-byte proxy shared by the instances. Preparation
reached 153.208 ms. Only the selected eye part changes among Linlong's 30 and Robin's 83 public
material bindings, including final comparisons of generated soft bindings. Native hotloader
`module.cpp:619-627` (the local source, read only) selects separate soft names under Remix; the
controller covers the matching asset/slot's copy. Six Lua scenarios cover that lifecycle. All named
corpus whites have material alpha 0 or 1; five have no PMX texture path, so name hits alone do not
prove availability of a supported owned albedo at runtime.

- The production Lua matcher finds **522 surfaces in 493/1,225 PMX models** (27,096 materials) in
  the main checkout's `out/r10/corpus.jsonl`; **470/493** share their texture with other materials.
  PoC: **5/5** characters, five matched surfaces, all shared. Read-only field snapshot: **143 manifests,
  6,233 materials, 121 matches in 118 models**, 109 sharing their texture; 25 lack a recognized
  separate white. The brief's 144-library count differs from this snapshot. Reproduce with
  [eye_white_catalogue.py](../tools/qa/eye_white_catalogue.py.md); evidence `out/r10/catalogue.json`.
  Unnamed/combined surfaces cannot be inferred from names. Near misses are review candidates, not
  proven false negatives.
- PMX UV/geometry inspection confirms Ganyu's exact `eyeball` covers white eye regions (156
  triangles, centroid RGB median 255/255/255). Four `目白底` materials sample painted lower white
  backing. `目白框`/`目白边` sample dark rims (RGB medians 139/120/107 or 136/136/136). `eye_back`
  samples pink backing (215/192/200); `眼角膜` covers colored iris/cornea regions. Keep those excluded.
  Per-material bounds, UV overlays and color measurements: `out/r10/ambiguous-materials.json`,
  `uv-*.png`; original PMX/PNG files were read only through `rpai.pmx.read_pmx`.
- Robin's shipped PoC `pbr_robin/models/robin_r18_f9c3e4b4.usda:141-142` has fallback **0.6** and
  adaptive input **15**. Decoding the published 4096² DDS albedo/emission maps from sRGB and measuring
  **131,891** eroded sclera texels gives **15 × emission/albedo = 0.6276053226**, equal at p05/median/p95.
  The nominal class formula `.025/.6*15` is **0.625** (0.417% quantization difference). Automatic
  intensity uses 0.625 through C-16's helper, preserving source shading. Paths/results are in
  `out/r10/robin-reference.json`.
- The generated atlases inspected are VTF **7.2**, 80-byte header, RGBA8888 (format 0), one frame/depth,
  no thumbnail, mip data smallest-to-largest. DXVK hashes **subresource 0 pixels**, not file metadata
  (`d3d9_common_texture.cpp:672-684`, `d3d9_texture_hash.h:123` in the recorded fork). A header change
  cannot isolate an eye texture identity. The validated clone toggles one top-mip RGB low bit;
  alpha and lower mips remain byte-identical. Unsupported layouts fail closed.
- Hotloader `native_render.lua:93-105,303-306` binds public IMaterials, allowing an eye-only base
  texture change without a native-renderer hook. Remix tracking waits for a real draw
  (`material_lua_bindings.cpp:515-550,644` in the fixes source, read only). The original hash comes
  from immutable original/proxy helpers in a tiny offscreen 2D target on separate frames before world rebinding.
  Original-hash mod lookup precedes fallback in `SceneManager::determineMaterialData` (patch 0019),
  preserving authored pack emission. [ADR 0088](decisions/0088-imported-character-eye-whites.md)
  records filtering, compatibility, lifecycle and memory tradeoffs.
- PoC verification found distinct Lua `ITexture` wrappers need not compare equal: normalized texture
  names identify owned bindings for apply/restore. Source's queued tracker reliably observes immutable
  helpers on separate frames. The render guard needs their three exact bundled source paths; no broad
  exemption is added. An eye proxy must also inherit the original atlas's category snapshot, because
  the existing MMD-alpha scanner intentionally rejects a DATA texture outside `mmd/`.

## R8-C material review: loading, provenance and cost (2026-11-01)

The fixes' `remixlua/cl/cl_fix_pbr_materials.lua:50-72,88` inspects native ExoPBR shader/texture
fields after Material; inert objects lose those inputs. The hotloader's `mmdhl/client.lua:68-84`
creates screenspace_general with mmdhl_vs20/mmdhl_ps20b and then sets its textures; blanket creation
suppression breaks its immediate path. `loader/client/bootstrap.lua:169` compiles owned files with
@lua/<path> labels, omitting add-on identity. The reviewed guard uses an exact 344-path snapshot
checked against indexed package hashes plus companion/glass sources (no internal collisions after
retired glass is excluded). Other mounted add-ons or forged labels can collide and bypass the
material compatibility exemption; this does not authenticate Lua or grant native execution.

There is no evidence establishing that merely loading/reading these materials caused the tester's
crash. The known PoC loaded/exited normally; some shader warnings precede Lua. Native loading is
therefore retained. The review removes all material VMT preflight; only status/session startup
reads remain. Untrusted bindings inspect cached native shader/program fields. Entity bindings
resolve once through native Material per live cached path; trusted bindings add no such resolution.

In `out/r8-compat/material-cost.json`, three-run medians with a modeled 761-mount, 1 ms failed
lookup show the prior guard taking 1,205.573 ms/1,200 mixed paths, 1,204.843 ms/repeated paths and
1,214.444 ms/PNG+JPG icons: each batch makes 1,200 reads/913,200 modeled mount probes. The reviewed
guard makes zero material-preflight reads/probes and takes 0.299, 0.247 and 0.909 ms respectively.
Trusted new reads take 0.959 ms; first/repeat entity bindings 2.167/1.284 ms; fresh/repeat render
bindings 2.700/2.213 ms. Plain loads make zero metadata queries; entity repeats add zero native
resolutions or metadata queries. Windows QPC measures batch elapsed time with fake native objects;
mount probes and 1 ms are explicit assumptions, not field measurements. Native cold I/O and GPU
behavior remain unmeasured. Expected added guard VMT I/O is zero regardless of 761 mounts. See
[the reproducible harness](../tools/tests/bench_render_guard.py.md) and
[updated handover](handover/R8-C-report.md); the older preflight claims below describe the earlier implementation.

## R8-C: graphics add-ons, exact sources (2026-11-01)

[The second audit](audits/R8-C-addon-compat.md) and [hash ledger](audits/R8-C-addon-compat.json)
index 86 Lua/VMT files and 856 candidate API lines across eight exact installed Workshop archives.
Every indexed file matches its archive-entry CRC and SHA-256; source bodies remain in ignored
`out/r8-compat/src`. This is a static inventory, not an execution count. Quick Bloom is now exact: its
only client autorun writes two bloom cvars in Initialize. Life Mod legacy decoding is bounded and
its declared-length GMA passes all 98 entry CRCs and aggregate CRC 374141b9.

Claude's existing r8/07-gshader console contains 26 failed-shader lines, an intentional guard error
at bumps_building.lua:35 and one at worldpos.lua:27 through !!shaderlib.lua:800. The map loads/exits
normally there; the tester's crash is not reproduced. Raw RGBA32323232F29 is a documented Source
format, but the guard's old enum snapshot predates GShader exporting it. That false diagnostic is
separate from backend support: D3D9Ex dependencies, reserved target replacement, MRT/depth copies,
world-mesh reconstruction and shared light-metatable edits remain concrete capability risks.
[ADR 0086](decisions/0086-inert-shader-effects-and-safe-guard-fallbacks.md) makes the incompatible
work inert with real engine-backed fallbacks; it does not claim native/GPU fault recovery.

R8-C final offline checks pass 26 CTests and 488 Python tests (two existing symlink skips), with
40 guard methods/43 LuaJIT invocations including 18 new replay cases. Repeated GShader light
acquisition needs readback of its private metatable edits; returning a fresh native-table clone
on every call would reset the wrong __index table. The harness checks that readback and simulates
GLua ITexture type labels. Isolating GShader's native Remove override also requires retiring its exported projector-cache entries
and rebuilding their indices; the replay removes several lamps in sequence and requires an empty
cache afterward. No actual game, GPU or third-party Lua was executed. The new policy's
[harness and QA receipt](handover/R8-C-report.md) explicitly separates these results from the
original tester crash and foreign-initializer startup gap.

## R8-B: Backrooms native port (2026-11-01)

Fixes source `7094baf6edf6797fd5c3f0b58ca668f9307b4906` is based on packaged `a2c8dbc5`.
The Backrooms branch ends at `e4d548d`; 6b4794f's model-miss cache also needs the model-loader
hunk from `672ada9`. Its original `GetVtxFileChecksum` returns zero for missing, truncated and
zero-checksum files: treating all three as absence suppresses a valid lower mount. The port
reports genuine open failure separately (`source/modelload_fixes.cpp:418`, `:503`, `:519`),
keeps malformed-file fallback and caps the mutex-protected cache at 65,536 paths. Shutdown
clears it at `:1499`; hardware-cache flushes keep it. SDK `filesystem.h:515` specifies that a null
path ID searches all paths; null/all-path misses and GAME misses therefore have separate keys.

The lazy transform is consumed by bone upload at `source/HardwareSkinningHooks.cpp:3179`
and `:3525`, including the protected automatic oversized path with force-hardware off; per-strip
state resolves at `:3618`. Nested studio draws preserve pending/cached state at `:3751`.
`source/culling_patches.cpp:408` validates the unique executable CM_Vis locator and engine-relative
globals; `:446` validates the vis lump and offset table. SDK `bspfile.h:85` and `:91` define
65,536 clusters and 16 MiB of visibility. `:475` restores still-owned PVS offsets at module close;
default-off synchronization does not read the vis table. PAS uses existing engine vis streams,
not a new BSP decoder. It cannot change a separate multiplayer server's visibility decisions.

Offline checks passed: three production-code harnesses, existing oversized-skinning and
memory-limit tests, unchanged PE imports/exports, 2,334 pinned dependency files and a clean
patch reconstruction. DLL size is 4,864,512 bytes (16,896 above the packaged R6 DLL).
Static add-on/API review found 1,682 lights in gm_br_complex and 2,687 in gm_br_pitfalls;
package Lua already provides the native lighting globals, Light2RTX clearing and updater hooks,
and packaged NikNaks has PASForOrigin. No game/frame-time measurement was made in R8-B.
Details and exact hashes: [corresponding source](../packages/fixes/licenses/oversized-skinning/backrooms/Source.md).

## R7-B: external exit diagnostics (2026-11-01)

The final text review caught lossy catalog generation through Windows PowerShell 5.1's
ASCII native-pipeline encoding (code page 20127): original UTF-8 labels survived, while new
non-ASCII text became `?`. A before-failing Python catalog check and embedded C++ message
checks now reject it. Writing the catalog through a UTF-8 source file restored the text;
the full catalog then exceeded MSVC's 16 KiB single-literal limit. CMake now concatenates
adjacent raw literals at existing label-file line boundaries, preserving the bytes. The
native French dialog probe is repeated against that corrected embedded catalog, not merely
against the source JSON.

Final Release gate: 26/26 CTests (36.50 s) and 455 Python tests (28 gmapack, 25 steam,
402 tools; two expected fixture skips). `out/r7-b/release-verified.log` records the pass.
A separate native-window probe (`out/r7-b/dialog-probe.json`) observed exactly one visible
French dialog after a synthetic access-violation exit, checked the title/body/code/folder,
acknowledged only that observer's OK button and verified its process then exited. Its
`+gmod_language fr` correctly beat the synthetic config's archived Japanese setting. This
does not exercise GMod, Remix's own prompt or a real resource fault.

The final parallel native run measured empty evidence collection at 1.379 ms mean / 4.073 ms
maximum over 30 starts (an earlier isolated run: 0.484 / 0.676 ms). Startup's observer handshake
has a separate 3 s readiness bound, not included in those collector numbers. The first full gate
exposed the existing `loader/guard/tests/test_early.cpp` unprefixed timestamp path over MAX_PATH;
using `fs::long_path` for its timestamp getter/setter removes the need for a local build-output
path workaround. The fixture still proves that repeated preparation does not rewrite the cache.

The same built proxy works inside System32 `rundll32.exe` with its DllMain loader guard.
The synthetic integration covers 23 cases, including a genuinely separate sleeping observer,
an inherited restricted game handle, process/path/creation/parent validation, exit before JSON
and observer termination afterward. The actual exception/OOM/driver failures are simulated
exit codes/logs, not resource exhaustion. The bootstrap remains KERNEL32-only; MessageBoxW
is resolved dynamically after exit. No executable is extracted or downloaded.

`loader/proxy/observer.cpp` starts/validates/waits; `loader/proxy/exit_report.cpp` selects and
formats the seven catalogs. `loader/core/src/evidence.cpp` shares `classify` and archive copying
between exit and startup. The end marker lets the next collector reuse the same reason/folder,
and prevents clean sessions without a Remix shutdown marker from filling the five-archive queue.
Fresh `.nvdbg` shader-debug information is copied as context but no longer proves a crash;
actual GPU dumps use `.nv-gpudmp` (the fork's writer is recorded in runtime patch 0001).

Memory inference is deliberately narrower than the map warning: <=512 MiB free commit in a
sample <=30 seconds old, tied to the same process token (snapshot) or start/end interval (CSV),
and only for a generic nonzero exit without stronger evidence. The reason is
`likely_out_of_memory`; concrete exceptions keep their exception classification/code. A zero
exit stays clean unless a fresh fatal Remix message/marker or actual crash artifact exists.

## R7-B: commit headroom from the saved R6 runs (2026-11-01)

Read-only reanalysis of the main checkout's `out/qa-poc/r6/tiers*/<run>/memory.csv`;
no game or new measurement session was started. Each CSV includes earlier sessions, so the
last bootstrap sample with private bytes below 256 MiB identifies the current session's start.
The damaged `tiers-pinned/04-house-auto-pin` snapshot has no such sample and is excluded.
These are whole-start-to-map differences, deliberately conservative for a warning at the menu;
system commit includes other programs and ten-second sampling can miss transient peaks.

Across the 24 usable runs, added commit spans 11.074-16.184 GiB. The runtime's GPU
snapshots and the tier comparison in [ADR 0064](decisions/0064-performance-tier-defaults.md#poc-measurements-2026-10-31)
measure VRAM, not CPU commit; lower tiers do not justify a dramatically smaller system reserve.
`loader/core/src/memory.cpp` therefore warns strictly below 18 GiB free commit, or a
24 GiB total limit. This is a conservative heuristic (about 1.8 GiB above the largest
sampled increase), not a map-fit guarantee. Unknown limits do not warn; subtraction saturates.
64.0 / 90.6 GiB leaves 26.6 GiB and stays quiet. The small-limit floor replaces R6's 32 GiB floor.

## G1-A second pass: client build cost (2026-11-01)

- Full Release gate exits 0: repo conventions, 25/25 CTests (48.67 s), and 453 Python tests
  (28 gmapack, 25 steam, 400 tools, two existing skips). All 50 G1-A glass tests execute.
  The tools tests take 79.927 s. Evidence: `out/g1-lua-fix2/release.log`. No G1-B/native/Jolt,
  QA, package or Workshop configuration paths were edited in this branch.

- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/client.lua:102` queues a dirty pane once; `:114` drains it after the
  receiving FrameNumber with a two-pane cap and a soft 1 ms elapsed-time stop. A whole break
  clears stale meshes/collision immediately. Removal/snapshot replacement/cleanup invalidate
  pending entries. `Attach` preserves collision dirtiness for an entity arriving while queued.
  Current contact-default anchors are `config.lua:7`, `damage.lua:71` and `server.lua:154`
  in the same directory (the earlier contact note's fallback line numbers were one line late).
- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/geometry.lua:74` supplies mesh and convex positions from one extrusion;
  face fans and crack strips share read-only vertex records. The crack strip builder at
  `client.lua:73` also makes winding agree with outward normals on both faces. The engine
  harness checks position identity, triangle counts, winding, queue bounds/coalescing and
  cancellation including late entities and a whole break overtaking partial work.
- Updated 40-sample benchmark on the same 100-hit preparation: ad3ed46 has 502 cells, this pass
  164. Client break handler mean/p99 13.5920/20.7774 -> 1.8676/2.6174 ms; deferred build after
  1.0124/2.1511 ms; per-sample combined cost 13.5931/20.7784 -> 2.8800/4.5732 ms. Hit combined
  cost 13.3168/21.9155 -> 3.2667/5.6801 ms. The queue does not hide deferred work in these sums.
  Initial snapshot/attach is outside timing; engine/physics/transport/debris are mocked.
  This is CPU evidence only, not GMod or Remix frame-time acceptance.
- The stronger active-cap coarsening probe peaks at 199 cells with 0.048986 units² area error;
  36,015 generated edges remain at least 1/256 long. The typed snapshot is 5,723 bytes for
  176 live cells/7 groups. New density/lit/default/defer regressions fail on ad3ed46; all
  50 glass cases pass now. Logs remain under this worktree's `out/g1-lua-fix2/`.

## G1-A second pass: lit cracks and walking (2026-11-01)

- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/client.lua:7` creates `nlglass_frost_lit` with VertexLitGeneric and
  `models/debug/debugwhite`, no selfillum. A new name avoids the existing material cache after
  Lua refresh. The `lit_cracks` mock checks the shader and strips at z=±0.515 for thickness 1,
  outward normals, equal front/back vertices and full width at most 0.20 units. Whether Remix
  shades those strips correctly at night/in a dark room remains a real renderer check.
- `config.lua:7` now defaults the replicated contact speed to 250; `damage.lua:72` and
  `server.lua:155` use the same fallback. The `walk_run` harness checks contacts/sweeps at
  200/249 (no damage) and 250/400 (damage), menu value and admin reset to 250. Existing archived
  values remain user choices. The menu help and six MIT catalogs include the default guidance.

## G1-A second pass: break density (2026-11-01)

- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/fracture.lua:7` defines kind-specific active caps (200 annealed,
  300 tempered) within MAX_CELLS=512. `rings` stretches only the final outer ring when its
  ray/ring product exhausts the budget; `uniform` bounds its row/column product explicitly.
  `Apply` coarsens before assigning refined cells, so every release is bounded without losing
  area. Repeated radius queries no longer build unused tile polygons.
- `tools/tests/nlglass_fracture_harness.lua density` fails on ad3ed46 and passes after the fix.
  At spacing 8, seed 171 and a 2-unit corner inset, annealed fresh/damaged whole-break counts
  are 89/160 centre and 52/197 corner (96x64), 116/170 and 63/184 (256x128), 116/151 and
  65/182 (128x256). Damaged means 24 prior 180,000-energy spatial visual-only native hits.
  Tempered counts are 96, 300 and 300 at either location, fresh or damaged. The harness also
  checks 8192x1, 1x8192, 8192x8192, spacings 4/8/64 and conserved total area.
- Local pre-change handler baseline: 502 prepared cells, 40 samples, client break mean/p99
  14.5843/23.7406 ms. This differs from the first-pass handover's earlier machine/load sample;
  both measure mocked engine calls, not live frame time. Lower-cap pure-fracture means over
  80 samples (164 cells): hit 0.4183, repeat 0.0652, break 0.1389 ms versus local baseline
  0.6187/0.0805/0.5113 ms at 502 cells. Evidence stays in this worktree's ignored
  `out/g1-lua-fix2/`. No game or install was changed.

## G1-B second pass: final offline receipt (2026-11-01)

- Final matched QPC samples (`out/g1-native-fix2/render-before-final.log` / `render-after-final.log`):
  moving Think+draw means 0.1623 -> 0.1650 ms with all 2,000 pieces visible; mixed visibility
  0.1349 -> 0.1144 ms (2,000 -> 500 draws); settled 0.0155 -> 0.0119 ms (15 -> four draws).
  Settling allocates 41,795 -> 14,220 KiB with GC stopped, including 288,000 -> 47,952 Vector
  and 144,000 -> zero Angle constructions. The mocks omit real engine-call and GPU cost.
- Source anchors: `debris_mesh.lua:59` mutates shared transformed vertices; `debris_batches.lua:5`
  bounds upload/preparation work, `:102` stages rebuild/retirement and `:133` culls settled areas;
  `debris_draw.lua:19` groups individual draws; `debris_view.lua:25` tests spheres and projected
  size using camera depth; `debris.lua:196` publishes the manager's rolling metrics. All are
  under `glass/addon/lua/nlglass`. A slow-vector double yields before the count cap, and a 2.5 ms
  upload injection remains in the peak statistic after quiet frames.
- Release passes 25 CTests/448 Python tests (two existing skips) after the already documented
  local guard-output shortening; 19 native glass cases pass. The unchanged native test drops
  4,000 colliding pieces to sleep in 11.0167 simulated seconds with zero contact overflows;
  settled core step+poses averages 0.00165 ms. It runs alongside the full test suite, not a game.
  Separate final Lua manager/probe checks pass 14,576 assertions. No game frame target is claimed.

## G1-B second pass: moving draw work and attribution (2026-11-01)

- `debris_draw.lua` maintains individual material groups; a fully visible 2,000-piece mock frame
  binds once instead of 2,000 times. Across 240 frames, setters fall from 1,440,000 to 962,000
  (two pose setters per piece/update plus one initial scale setter). Repeated draw passes with
  unchanged poses perform no matrix writes. No per-piece Vector/Angle/Matrix is constructed by
  either warmed draw path; the change avoids engine calls and culls work rather than claiming
  the original draw path allocated those userdata every frame.
- `debris_view.lua` uses the render view, numeric Source basis and conservative sphere bounds;
  the controlled mixed scene retains 500 of 2,000 pieces, rejecting rear, beyond-8192-unit and
  distant subpixel pieces. It submits 500 rather than 2,000 draws. Engine doubles make material
  and matrix calls effectively free: fully-visible Think+draw **increases** from 0.132 to 0.164 ms
  with culling/instrumentation, while mixed visibility falls from 0.129 to 0.115 ms. This does not
  measure the reduced real-engine binding/GPU cost and does not prove the <20 ms game target.
- `debris.lua` records 120-frame Think/draw means, last and peak samples; draw passes sharing
  FrameNumber accumulate before publication. Injecting 1.25 ms Think work and 0.4 ms/mesh for two
  two-mesh passes produces exactly 1.25 ms Think, 1.6 ms draw and four calls/frame. Rebuild and
  upload peaks survive quiet frames. These fields separate hook work from asynchronous Jolt;
  Spawn/fracture outside Think and GPU time are explicitly excluded.

## G1-B second pass: pile allocation and draw findings (2026-11-01)

- Read-only game receipts: `out/qa-poc/g1/03-qa/console.log:657,660,662` in the main checkout
  report 678 sleeping pieces/40 batches at 8.71 ms mean, 2,000 live/1,453 moving at 33.83 ms
  (Jolt 1.5816 ms), then 2,000 sleeping/388 batches at 11.91 ms mean, p99 28.95 ms. These
  frame spikes cannot be attributed precisely from those aggregate logs alone.
- Before the second pass, `debris_batches.lua` grouped 256-unit XYZ cells by material **and
  color**, uploaded at most 6,000 vertices, and `debris_mesh.lua:57` called `LocalToWorld`
  twice per transformed vertex. A controlled 2,000-quad/50-location LuaJIT sample allocates
  41,624 KiB while settling, including 288,000 Vector and 144,000 Angle constructions.
  This is a concrete source of later GC pressure; engine/Remix spikes still need game attribution.
- Consolidating into offset 1024-unit cells by material, with vertex colors preserved and one
  shared 24,000-record upload pool, reduces the same sample from 15 to four settled draws and
  to 14,209 KiB allocated, 47,952 Vector constructions and **zero** Angle constructions while
  settling. A warmed rebuild allocates no vertex vectors. The color/grid-zero regression puts
  all 2,000 pieces into four draws in one area. Source-basis position/normal comparisons pass.
  GPU releases now spread across frames; transforms have count and measured time caps. These
  measurements use engine/physics doubles, QPC and stopped GC; actual uploads/GPU costs are absent.

## G1-A client/update fix pass: final offline evidence (2026-11-01)

- Implementation anchors: `damage.lua:65` (side/proximity contact), `server.lua:86` (quiet outputs),
  `server.lua:151` (incoming/base-velocity sweep), `server.lua:286` (targeted sync), all under
  `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/`. Fracture anchors there: `fracture.lua:104` (capped crack floor),
  `:258`/`:286` (complete-group coarsening/local refinement), `:343`/`:451` (apply/crack caches).
  Client anchors: `client.lua:22`/`:50`/`:162` (pose cache/build/draw), `protocol.lua:13` (snapshot).

- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/client.lua` retains matrices/entity validation and refreshes transforms
  only after a pose change. The draw harness checks 20 frames with zero new Matrix, LocalToWorld
  or class calls; far/rear panes are skipped. A break builds prediction physics once and at most
  one pane/crack mesh pair. Pending weak energy builds neither. Initial sync is client-ready only;
  a mismatch requests one pane and two different panes can repair in the same frame.
- The corrected 40-sample handler benchmark restores fresh server/client records before each
  sample (so stale revisions cannot short-circuit later samples). Same 100 preparation hits,
  493/502 cells before/after. Mean ms before/after: server hit 14.2875/5.3019; server break
  18.9326/10.3577; client hit 45.3190/27.7840; client break 84.1545/23.7365. p99 ms:
  39.5452/16.4711; 37.8406/25.0744; 73.6096/52.1866; 118.3529/46.5227 respectively.
  These include Lua mesh/convex construction and mock overhead/GC, not actual engine/GPU physics,
  transport, debris/Jolt or Remix. They do not establish game frame-rate acceptance.
- Final pure-fracture 80-sample means: new hit 0.8426 ms, repeat 0.0961 ms, break 0.6749 ms;
  p99 2.6709/0.6155/1.9264 ms. Existing before means were 12.5675/13.6601/14.5538 ms.
- [Entity:SetVelocity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetVelocity) sets base velocity,
  added to player movement; [GetBaseVelocity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetBaseVelocity)
  exposes it. The QA runner's scripted push needs this in addition to CMoveData velocity. Tests
  cover ordinary incoming motion with stopped entity velocity and zero movement velocity with a
  500-unit/s base impulse. The old logs have no Touch/velocity trace, so exact engine callback
  timing is still a game check. Native-removal blast order is separately tested with deferred breaks.
- Full `tools/test.ps1 -Config Release`: 25 CTests, 448 Python tests (28 gmapack, 25 steam,
  395 tools; two existing skips), including 45 G1-A glass cases. Output and before-failure/timing
  evidence are under this worktree's ignored `out/g1a/`; original QA evidence was read only.

## G1-A incremental fracture probes (2026-11-01)

- `tools/tests/nlglass_fracture_harness.lua` now reproduces lost hit location at the fourth
  separated impact against 3096b2e, sub-floor energy loss, full tempered grid cracks, a 1/1024
  clipped edge and border cracks. All fail before the fix and pass after it. The 180-seed edge
  probe checks 36,015 generated edges at or above 1/256. The 100-hit coarsening probe peaks at
  512 cells with area error 0.01414 on a 32,768-unit² pane; another preserves an existing hole.
- The same 80-sample high-resolution near-cap workload (100 preparation hits outside timing)
  measured before/after mean new-hit 12.5675/1.1596 ms, repeat 13.6601/0.1359 ms and break
  14.5538/0.8603 ms. Before/after p99: hit 20.8927/2.7537, repeat 23.7746/1.4296, break
  23.1292/3.1285 ms. Prepared cell counts: 493/502. These are LuaJIT fracture CPU times;
  no GMod, native debris, physics initialization, rendering or network transport is measured.
- `tools/tests/nlglass_engine_harness.lua topology` round-trips 501 live cells and 47 complete
  subdivision groups in 16,721 bytes, then compares the next break's polygons. Remaining/crack
  caches avoid repeated support passes; only a breakout needs adjacency/support traversal.

## G1-A contact and hidden-surface output investigation (2026-11-01)

- In the read-only `out/qa-poc/g1/02-qa/console.log`, the 40-pane falling scene reports mean
  17.66 ms, p99 292.93 ms; empty 8.33 ms, settled 8.88 ms, all on the 64-piece VPhysics fallback.
  The QA player step supplies 500 units/s toward an upright 64×96 pane but leaves it intact.
  `tools/qa/nlglass_qa/lua/autorun/nlglass_qa.lua` sets that velocity before the mover stops it;
  `glass/addon/lua/entities/nlglass_pane/init.lua` previously relied only on Touch/GetVelocity.
  This explains a missed incoming velocity path; actual callback timing still requires game QA.
- [Facepunch SetupMove](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:SetupMove) runs before engine movement.
  [EntityKeyValue](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:EntityKeyValue) captures repeated output keys;
  [GetKeyValues](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetKeyValues) does not expose all keys;
  [TriggerOutput](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:TriggerOutput) is a scripted-base helper,
  not direct access to the native brush's output objects.
- [Valve func_breakablesurf.cpp](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/src/game/server/func_breakablesurf.cpp)
  lines 562–579 play PhysBreakSound and fire inherited OnBreak. InputShatter (668–715) calls
  Die and ShatterPane. NoDraw cannot suppress these events. The surface datadesc (143–172) adds
  no OnShatter output. The replacement now mirrors captured OnBreak keys to an unused native user
  channel, preserving raw parameter/delay/count strings instead of requesting engine fracture.

## G1-A glass: offline executable evidence (2026-10-31)

- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/damage.lua:58` reads `CollisionData.HitObject` as the PhysObj itself,
  including `GetMass`; relative velocity uses `TheirOldVelocity - OurOldVelocity`. The mocked
  PhysObj deliberately has no `GetPhysicsObject`. A 120 kg hitter at relative 180 units/s produces
  1,944,000 game energy, identically for a prop and ragdoll. `:65` admits moving players, NPCs and
  vehicles, excludes slow/tangential contacts and tests the remaining polygons to avoid ghost hits
  in holes. The server defers physics reconstruction outside PhysicsCollide callbacks.
- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/fracture.lua:87` supplies the tunable 450,000 reference breaking threshold
  (96×64, thickness 1, annealed, strength 1), 8% crack threshold and 3.5× tempered threshold. The
  pure LuaJIT probe `out/g1-a/fracture-smoke.lua`, seed 100, returns 58 cells after a 180,000-energy
  centre hit, 86 visible crack segments then 109 after the second hit; the third releases 40 cells
  and leaves 18 in the frame. Their full area sums to 6144. These are synthetic energy/geometry
  measurements, not observed damage from the game's pistol.
- `fracture.lua:2`, `:233` cap impacts at eight and cells at 512; nearest-centre merging preserves
  energy and the seed/cuts. Snapshot replay and fresh-process outputs match. The pure harness
  disables global random, sin/cos and sqrt; no libm call controls tessellation. Crack edges from
  the first hit occur in the final cells. Shared-edge connectivity releases unsupported islands
  and keeps support across an edge subdivided by another cut.
- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/protocol.lua:3` encodes an impact in 148 bits (19 rounded-up bytes):
  24-bit x/y at 1/1024 units, 31-bit energy/seed, two-bit kind, three signed 12-bit directions.
  With pane ID, revision and three flags, the ordinary event is 215 bits (27 bytes). Breaks carry
  the prior bounded state; a test deliberately misses the create packet and removes the entity
  before client replay, yet all pieces reach the debris stub. Late join creates no old debris.
- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/client.lua:17` mirrors remaining frozen convexes for prediction, attaches
  after late entity networking and rejects an index reused by an unrelated class. The wire carries
  entity-local frame offsets, so delayed client poses do not introduce a permanent geometry offset.
- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/server.lua:76` retains the original hidden/non-solid surface brush and
  fires one covering Shatter input on first breakout; the harness proves bypass/routing and that
  a partial pane remains. It does **not** prove Source's Hammer output semantics for a hidden brush.
  Native `func_breakable` retains engine health/collision; `:152` sends pieces once across break
  events/removal, using last damage, breaker pose/velocity or a nominal centre impact. `:241`
  invalidates pending native removals during cleanup. Restored panes keep their output bridge;
  duplicates do not take it from the original.
- The companion relocates category `Glass Rewrite Remixed` to Water and glass
  (`companion/nativeloader/lua/autorun/client/nativeloader_menu.lua:20`). G1 retains that category
  and `GlassSettings` (`glass/addon/lua/nlglass/menu.lua:72`) plus `glass_open_panel` and
  `rtx_glass_player_break_speed`, avoiding an orphaned settings page. Non-English MIT catalogs are
  newly agent-written and await human review. Actual weapon tuning, engine outputs, prediction,
  Remix frosting and the 50-window performance baseline remain game acceptance.

## G1-B: dedicated glass world and offline measurements (2026-10-31)

- Final QA refinement (2026-11-01): the 4,000-piece benchmark now reserves **8192** bodies, exactly
  as the manager does, rather than reserving only 4000. With that reserve it still slept in
  **11.0167 simulated seconds**: spawn **42.35 ms**, simulation **6.384 s wall / 31.281 s process
  CPU**, fixed-step **9.657 ms mean / 17.063 ms maximum**, settled step+poses **0.1225 ms**.
  The fixture uses axis-aligned rectangular shards and zero initial spin/velocity. These are
  core-test figures, not game/rendering figures; evidence is `out/native-tests-qa.log`. Compressed
  `sprp` tests now exercise both directory-length conventions, and the displacement fixture also
  verifies omission of an authored hole. The earlier 4000-reserve measurements below are retained.

- Pinned Jolt `v5.3.0`: the only downloaded archive was
  `https://codeload.github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics/zip/refs/tags/v5.3.0`, SHA-256
  `ee47dbd3de026829bc9734eeed960118c3d0a1a61b16e172009731a407d1466a`. All 444 vendored
  upstream files were compared directly against the archive and matched; our README is separate.
- Source's collision-lump LZMA wrapper is treated as 17 bytes: `LZMA`, original size, packed size,
  five decoder properties; it is not the loader's 13-byte standalone LZMA header. The reader limits
  expanded sizes and dictionary before calling the existing SDK decoder
  (`glass/native/bsp.cpp:36`). Generated compressed-leaf and damaged-input tests cover this path.
- The importer traverses model 0's world tree, rather than importing the brush lump wholesale:
  nodes are 32 bytes, leaves v0/v1 are 56/32 bytes, models 48 bytes, brushes 12 bytes and sides
  8 bytes. `0x400b` selects solid/window/grate/moveable contents; playerclip/water/entity-only
  brushes are excluded (`glass/native/bsp.cpp:78`). Displacement records are 176 bytes, vertices
  20 bytes, faces 56 bytes; surface-tagged triangles from powers 2-4 collide on both sides
  (`glass/native/bsp.cpp:121`, `glass/native/world.cpp`). These are offline-supported layouts;
  real mounted-map compatibility remains game QA, not a claim that every Source derivative works.
- `sprp` origin/angles/model/solidity use byte offsets 0/12/24/30; supported records have strides
  56-80 bytes (v4-11), with v11 uniform scale at 76. Compressed child lumps can advertise packed
  or original directory length (`glass/native/bsp.cpp:169`). The generated fixture includes a
  scaled solid prop and a non-solid decoration; native tests also drop bodies onto that prop and
  onto the generated displacement, proving collision rather than just parser counts.
- Jolt's fixed-only `TempAllocatorImpl` explicitly calls `std::abort()` on exhaustion
  (`third_party/jolt/Jolt/Core/TempAllocator.h`); this module uses
  `TempAllocatorImplWithMallocFallback` instead. Main physics/contact capacities remain bounded
  and contact overflow is a controlled error; a 128-body overlapping fixture tests both overflow
  and the piece-collision-off filter (`glass/native/tests/test_glass.cpp`).
- Release, Ryzen 9 9950X3D (16 cores/32 hardware threads), eight Jolt workers: 4,000 4x4x0.6-unit
  shards in four layers, against each other and the generated room, all slept after **11.0167 s
  simulated**. Isolated final implementation run: **42.67 ms spawn**, **5.531 s simulation wall**,
  **28.766 s process CPU** (`GetProcessTimes`, sum over all threads), **8.367 ms mean / 13.596 ms
  maximum fixed step**. Once asleep, 120 calls to step plus pose output averaged **0.0908 ms**.
  Test bounds are 15 simulated seconds, 30 wall seconds and 120 process CPU seconds. This is a
  physics/core measurement, with no game or Remix draw cost (`glass/native/tests/test_glass.cpp`,
  evidence `out/native-tests-impl.log`).
- The `ILuaBase` double executes the actual callbacks and refuses metamethod/engine-call paths;
  `ReadPoses` creates no Lua tables or Vector/Angle userdata. The real Lua manager/probe execute
  under LuaJIT with mocks, including cleanup, batch invalidation and preserving edits made during
  a probe's temporary convar override (`tools/tests/glass_debris_harness.lua`).

## C-16: in-game tuning of the eye whites (2026-10-31)

- Client Lua may not run `lua_run`: `RunConsoleCommand("lua_run", ...)` prints
  `[ERROR] RunConsoleCommand: Command is blocked! (lua_run)` (the first probe's console). The same
  line sent as console text works: `poc_session.py --console` posts it with `WM_COPYDATA`
  (`tools/poc_session.py:635-653`) after the map and before `--lua` files (`:1047-1051`); Source only
  splits it at `;` and cuts it at `//`.
- Model Hotloader's server ignores a requested position: `mmdhl/server.lua:143-149` spawns at the
  player's eye trace (`HitPos + HitNormal * 3`, refused beyond 4096 units or on the sky), turned
  toward the player (`settings.lua:35-41`). Client Lua removes what it spawned with
  `mmdhl.Action("remove", nil, ent)` (`client.lua:173`, served at `server.lua:162`).
- gm_construct's spawn points used: (831, 576), (952, -512) and (823, -210), all at z -143.08, yaw
  180, pitch 0; the eye trace lands 3,250-3,460 units west on the field. The landing spot changes the
  light, not only the framing: at (952, -512) Robin's cheek measured 0.0072 at night, at (831, 576)
  0.0140. Placing the player on (831.235, 576, -143.08) at angles (0, 180, 0) reproduced the head
  position to 0.01 units and the frame with no pixel shift.
- Under Remix, `render.GetLightColor` returned 0 at every candidate interior point on gm_construct,
  so it cannot rank how dim a room is. `util.IsInWorld` is server-only; on the client
  `util.PointContents(pos)` without `CONTENTS_SOLID` stands in. A floor point under a full roof (no sky
  straight up or 45 degrees up in eight directions) with walls on seven sides found 15 rooms within
  6000 units of (831, 576); most are one building east of the spawn, floor z -144, ceiling 176-192
  (for example (1227, -1669, -144), walls 267-700 units away). A looser test (sky only straight up)
  picked (-1386, -2067, -128), an alley under an overhang, where the spawned ragdoll was not valid on
  the client three seconds after `ready`.
- The runtime's exposure (`auto_exposure.comp.slang:86,147-150`) is `0.18 / (Yf + 0.0032)`, capped
  at `rtx.autoExposure.maxExposure` (16 in the package); patch 0016's `adapted_yf` is that frame's
  centre-weighted geometric mean, while the exposure is smoothed (tau 0.15 s brightening, 0.75 s
  darkening, `rtx_auto_exposure.h:132-144`). At night the log showed `adapted_yf` 0.00046-0.00069 at
  exposure 16.
- Patch 0016's packing is lossless in this fork: the DLSS control mask's alpha byte is always `0xff`
  (`rtx_materials.h:982-986`), and the invalid subsurface index `SURFACE_INDEX_INVALID` is
  `0x001FFFFF` (`common_binding_indices.h:162`), inside the 24 bits kept.
- The eye white over the cheek (Robin, the probe's framing) is linear in the adaptive ratio in every
  condition. Per `1/0.18` of ratio: noon 0.107, golden hour 0.223, dusk 0.083, night 0.11; the
  intercepts (the eye's lit part alone) 0.51, 0.39, 0.40 and 0.20. Ratio 25 then gives 0.98, 1.38,
  0.77 and 0.70 (measured; interpolation predicted 0.99, 1.39, 0.77, 0.70). Fixed emission gave 0.69,
  0.52, 0.88 and 46 ([ADR 0069](decisions/0069-tuned-adaptive-eye-emission.md)).

## C16-B: publishing scene-adaptive eye emission (2026-10-31)

- `skills/mmd-remix-pbr/tool/rpai/compose.py:618-630` normalises the emissive map by its largest
  class weight `S`; `cli.py:411-420` restores `S * I` at publish and now writes adaptive intensity
  `(S * I) * R` for cached maps whose coverage includes `sclera`, `eye` or `highlight`. No maps
  or class weights need regeneration. `config.py:59` sets provisional `R = 1 / 0.18`.
  Class coverage at `cli.py:324` is rounded to four decimals, but its keys include every present
  class, so publish tests key presence even when a tiny eye region's coverage rounded to zero.
- `packages/runtime/layers/classic_remix_defaults.conf:59` sets `targetAdaptedYf = 0.18`
  (`maxExposure = 16` at line 146). Using the C16 plan's exposure equation, mid exposure 1 gives
  `L_mid = 0.18`, ignoring noise. Thus `M * (F / 0.18) * L_mid = M * F`: the old eye-white
  `C * 0.025 * I` at that reference. This is a derivation, not an in-game brightness measurement.
- Read-only PoC pack inventory: `pbr_robin/models/robin_r18_f9c3e4b4.usda:136-191` has three
  emissive overrides (`203355325A5208A0`, `70EC49FA6891154F`, `06DDF9D48A2DC2B1`), all fallback
  0.6. Evernight's `models/evernight_cf3eec2f.usda:64-69` has `596BBF16AC554B2E` at 0.6;
  March 7th's `models/model_e2c25f9e.usda:50-55` has `175BEFCBA6AE4083` at 0.04. Guinaifen's
  `models/new_mmd_model_1c2ed2fc.usda:93-123` has `4D84DF2D4E18DDE1` and `C8A78C7CF9EE33F2`
  at 0.6. The different normalisations require a per-fallback ratio when migrating together.
- Demonstrated `set_adaptive_emission.py --multiplier 5.555555555555555` on copies under
  `out/c16-b/packs/`: seven inputs added across four model layers, values 3.33333333 (fallback
  0.6) and 0.222222222 (fallback 0.04). All 157 original files (32/79/46 by pack) were hashed
  before copying and after the demonstration; their hashes and modification times match.
  Dry runs and repeat runs preserve every copied byte/timestamp; only the seven inserted lines
  change layer bytes, with `mod.usda` touched for reload. Evidence: `out/c16-b/demonstration.json`
  and per-pack command logs. No game was launched or install written.
- `scripts/package_characters.py:74-78` within the skill copies and checks USD layers byte for
  byte, retaining adaptive and fixed inputs. `scripts/set_adaptive_emission.py:44-118` masks
  literals/comments and edits byte ranges; `:138-174` preflights every layer before writes,
  reports changed material names and touches the existing root only after an actual edit.

## R6 T3: independent-review fixes (2026-10-31)

- At base `7759c43`, `loader/core/src/config.cpp:52,78` permits neither a top-level `diagnostics`
  nor `remix.performance_tier`; `loader/core/src/startup.cpp:132-135` turns configuration errors
  into `may_activate = false`. Workshop companion updates therefore gate new instructions on
  the additive I2 capability, not their own version. `dist/native-loader/config.json:1-6` has only
  schema and allow, so fragment-only examples neither describe the shipped file nor preserve trust.
- The fixes' `source/remixapi/remixapi.cpp:1311-1325` warns on every unavailable/failed VRAM API
  request; `resource_lua_bindings.cpp:38-71` returns nil for it. Three consecutive failures now
  stop automatic calls until an off/on retry or a map/start; late API availability stays supported.
- `skills/mmd-remix-pbr/tool/rpai/cli.py:391-418` replaces the model layer and prunes its unused
  DDS files under the chosen mod. `--mod` at `cli.py:621` supplies that folder name. A 2048 px
  publish must use a separate mod to preserve a larger variant's published textures.
- Full-access re-check reproduced the guard fixture's 262-character path failure in unchanged
  `test_early.cpp:198`; its shorter-output executable passes all 22 guard cases. The sandbox-only
  observations in the original T3 notes below are historical, not current access restrictions.
- The byte-identical default-layout guard executable (SHA-256 `698ce23a0abff6c8f90334f01f6864a2697c783e940bbc5ec9c4bfbb0cc928aa`)
  passes all 22 cases from `out/r6-t3-fix/guard-short`; full-access `tools/test.ps1 -Config Release`
  passes all 23 CTests and 288/28/25 tools/gmapack/Steam Python tests. The old registry/Git errors
  did not recur. Receipts are in `out/r6-t3-fix/`; no native source was changed.

## R6 T3: companion VRAM binding (2026-10-31)

- Read-only inspection of `garrys-mod-rtx-remixed/source/remixapi/resource_lua_bindings.cpp:38-71`
  confirms `RemixResource.GetVramStats()` returns a flat table with 14 numeric fields, or nil on
  failure. It exposes the driver budget/allocation, DXVK totals, retained pools, six RTX categories,
  the texture-cache count and D3D9 texture/buffer bytes.
- `dxvk-remix-gmod/public/include/remix/remix_c.h:1025-1053` defines the same fields. The driver
  allocation includes non-DXVK overhead such as DLSS/NGX and NRC CUDA; `forkTextureCacheCount` is a
  count, every other field bytes. The companion preserves those names and units in CSV and leaves
  missing fields blank for older modules.
- The PBR tool's `skills/mmd-remix-pbr/tool/rpai/cli.py:384-410` publishes the PNG maps already named
  in `generated.json`; it does not resize them. The `run` dispatch at `cli.py:654-659` generates
  before publishing. `config.py:80-96` applies per-texture size overrides after the global cap,
  including `"source"`, so an 8 GB variant needs generation at 2048 and a check of those overrides.
- Derived texture cost, excluding DDS headers: a full mip chain at 4096 square has about four
  times the bytes of one at 2048 square. BC7/BC5 cost about 21.3/5.3 MiB respectively; BC4 costs
  about 10.7/2.7 MiB. These are format arithmetic, not measured residency or savings on an 8 GB GPU.
- In this nested worktree the guard fixture's cache path is 262 characters long. Its idempotence
  case uses raw `std::filesystem::last_write_time` (`loader/guard/tests/test_early.cpp:198-200`) and
  fails with path-not-found in the default Release layout; other guard file operations already use
  extended-length paths. The unchanged guard suite passes with executables under the shorter
  `out/build/win64-release/bin`, configured only in the ignored CMake cache.
- Sandbox-only Release blockers: `tools/tests/test_field_snapshot.py:136` cannot create its
  throwaway `HKCU/Software/NativeLoaderTest_*` key (21 failures). A non-mutating `winreg.OpenKey`
  request for `KEY_CREATE_SUB_KEY` on HKCU Software also returns WinError 5, access denied. Six
  publisher tests fail at Git reads with "dubious ownership" because the checkout belongs to
  `matt-peng` and the test process runs as `CodexSandboxOnline`. No ACL, registry permission or
  global Git configuration was changed.

## R6 T6: tier inputs and DDS measurements (2026-10-31)

- Source files in `out/inputs/runtime/files/atmosphere/`, from the runtime input index: stars DXT5
  8192 × 8192 (89,478,640 bytes), galaxy DXT5 8192 × 4096 (44,739,408), nebula DX10 BC7 UNORM
  8192 × 8192 (89,478,660), all 14 mips. After dropping only mip 0 they have 13 mips and occupy
  22,369,776 / 11,184,976 / 22,369,796 bytes respectively. The original lower mips, including
  minimum 4 × 4 blocks, compare byte for byte (`tools/sky/drop_top_mip.py`). Derived texel storage
  falls from 213.33 to 53.33 MiB, exactly 160 MiB saved, excluding driver alignment/overhead.
- The three imported xz inputs add 14,811,108 bytes (14.13 MiB) to Git LFS, rather than the
  proposal's estimated 12 MB. The files and their uncompressed/stored hashes are indexed in
  `packages/runtime/files.json`; the original DDS inputs and runtime DLLs remain unchanged.
- At runtime commit `6f2dbd79`, `rtx_atmosphere.cpp`'s `resolveSkyTexturePath` joins a relative
  option to `runtimeFolder()`; `loadSkyTexture:731–813` allocates all declared mip levels and uploads
  each. The low-tier paths therefore need no loader substitution and do not depend on the game's
  working directory.
- At that same commit, `rtx_neural_radiance_cache.cpp:379–422` derives training settings when the
  NRC preset changes: Ultra 4 iterations/9 bounces/1 cm cache detail; High 3/7/4 cm; Medium 2/6/6 cm.
  The callback selects the Derived edit target, routed to User under Custom, so duplicating those
  training values in a lower tier layer cannot override it. The tier selects only the NRC preset.
- Source recheck: patched R6 T4 snapshot `29546f3566a676a1318b799fb8ddd01b2a110058`, C++ paths
  below relative to `src/dxvk/rtx_render/`. OMM's free-memory growth calculation includes the
  default 384 MiB buffer (`rtx_opacity_micromap_manager.h:58-64`, `.cpp:175-182`): medium/low
  leave 1408 MiB when calculating new growth budget, not 1024 MiB. Existing budget is retained
  between soft/hard limits; it is recalculated below 1024 MiB. `lowMemoryGpu` also halves the OMM
  VRAM percentage (`.cpp:162-173`), skips the top streamed replacement-texture mip
  (`rtx_texture_manager.cpp:1623`), and sets the low-memory AS build flag
  (`rtx_accel_manager.cpp:292-293`).
- A bounce-cap stop is not an NRC query:
  `src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/algorithm/integrator_indirect.slangh:860-885` resolves NRC termination first,
  then stops at the query path's bounce cap without
  querying the cache there. `rtx_neural_radiance_cache.cpp:697` sets NRC `maxPathVertices` from
  `trainingMaxPathBounces`. Mirror/transmission paths can lose light beyond the tier cap.
- **Changing `lowMemoryGpu` does not issue an incompatible AS UPDATE.** Automatic graphics
  selection writes it (`rtx_options.cpp:419-461`); the ordinary-GPU decision defaults false
  (`rtx_gpu_profile.h:55`) and sets true for at most 8 GiB (`:61`, `.cpp:212-220`). Both BLAS
  UPDATE sites guard with `validateUpdateMode` (`rtx_accel_manager.cpp:892-895,1258-1262`), whose
  flag comparison rejects the change (`:2011-2016`). The affected BLAS builds on next use instead;
  TLAS always uses BUILD (`:1946-1951`), as does the one-time intersection BLAS (`:296-312`).
  Expect rebuild/allocation work per affected BLAS, not an invalid UPDATE. Timing remains unmeasured.
  PoC tuning question: class-limited low on an RTX 3060 12 GB or 4060 Ti 16 GB still gets the top-mip
  drop despite its larger memory. On modern_house the switch saved about 226 MiB of replacement
  textures (ADR 0064); it stays, and following the VRAM tier instead needs a loader change.
- **The sky LOD argument is conditional.**
  `src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/pass/atmosphere/atmosphere_sky.slangh:408-439` uses real texture width/height.
  Halving them subtracts one from
  unclamped LOD, preserving samples only when original LOD >= 1. With native 3840 × 2160,
  90-degree horizontal FOV and zero mip bias, `pixel = 2/3840`: stars' minimum radial stretch
  from `:365-366,404-409` gives LOD >= 2.21; galaxy `:427-429` gives 1.03; nebula `:435-439`
  gives **0.44**, blending the missing original mip 0. The pixel angle includes FOV, traced height
  and mip bias (`rtx_atmosphere.cpp:2914-2916,2934-2941`; `rtx_scene_manager.cpp:320-346`).
  Narrow FOV/negative bias can expose mip 0 too. Medium therefore retains all original sky images
  pending PoC comparison; switching all three would save 160 MiB of texels but is not guaranteed
  visually identical even at a normal FOV in 4K.
- `tools/tests/test_runtime_tiers.py` pins the tier option types/ranges/enums to those patched
  declarations and their UI limits (including the six sky-probe extents in
  `src/dxvk/imgui/dxvk_imgui.cpp:3390-3399`). Every layer is parsed; classic/compiler bytes are pinned
  separately because classic contains 15 obsolete options with no matching current declaration
  (old exposure/localtonemap/bloom keys, `rtx.occluderTextures`, `rtx.tonemap.finalizeWithACES`).
  The source's `RtxOptions.md` SHA-256 is
  `4a457a8d1e3bb6dbf00efe05720fd9c8c4ea8621509fa72c6621313eb685cc57`. This avoids inventing
  runtime support for old high-tier keys while rejecting any new or misspelt tier key.
- PoC measurements of the tiers (2026-10-31, 4K, RTX 5090): medium and low 5-9 % faster than high,
  170-750 MiB less VRAM, identical pinned runs within 4.5 %; low now uses 8 bounces. Numbers and
  method in ADR 0064.
  [ADR 0064](decisions/0064-performance-tier-defaults.md) records the tuning and acceptance checks;
  run-specific history is in the [handover status](handover/R6-T6-performance-tiers.md#status).

## R6 T2 evidence boundaries (2026-10-31)

- The stock menu's [`lua/menu/mainmenu.lua`](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/lua/menu/mainmenu.lua#L23-L32)
  quotes string arguments to `lua.Run` and exposes `pnlMainMenu:Call` through `QueueJavascript`
  (lines 156-159, read 2026-10-31). R6 uses that bridge for bounded DATA reads and JSON-encodes parsed
  results again; it never concatenates raw file text into executable JavaScript.
- `loader/proxy/ui/mainmenu.js:30-63` validates creation-time tokens and a 30-second snapshot age,
  consumes a RAM warning only while visible before the first map, and acknowledges it in the menu
  Lua realm. `loader/core/src/memory.cpp:72-74` uses strict, overflow-safe 32-GiB/70-percent thresholds.

- `loader/core/src/memory.cpp` dynamically resolves `K32GetProcessMemoryInfo` and
  `K32GetPerformanceInfo` from KERNEL32 and converts performance-info page counts to bytes. DXGI
  is loaded from System32 and queried through `IDXGIAdapter3::QueryVideoMemoryInfo`; no PSAPI/DXGI
  import library is linked. Release's `check_imports.py` still reports only `KERNEL32.dll`.
- CSV rows use optional counters so an unavailable GPU query stays blank rather than appearing as
  zero usage. Two 360-row/256-KiB segments bound default history to about one to two hours. The
  latest system commit snapshot is independent of CSV history, so the RAM warning can work with
  `diagnostics.memory_telemetry: "off"` without recording process/GPU data.

- Release fixture measurement (30 consecutive empty collections on this machine): mean 0.556 ms,
  maximum 0.883 ms (a previous run averaged 1.419 ms, maximum 8.056 ms during concurrent work).
  Session-start metadata uses an atomic rename without the deployment journal's
  write-through flushes; its loss after a power failure falls back to the older loader record.
  Empty/clean starts do not re-hash old archives; retention runs only when a new archive is saved.
  A later measurement during concurrent Release checks averaged 1.145 ms, maximum 1.658 ms.

- The long T2 worktree makes the unchanged early-guard idempotence test's cache path 261 characters.
  `test_early.cpp:198` uses plain `std::filesystem::last_write_time` and fails there, despite the file
  existing and system `LongPathsEnabled=1`. An archived, rebuilt original commit `7759c43` fails at
  the same line; its identical executable passes when copied to the shorter worktree `out` path.
  T2's Release check uses a local CMake output-directory override only for that test executable;
  test sources and coverage are unchanged. No system setting or other worktree was changed.

- Runtime fork `src/util/log/log.cpp:75-94` opens `remix-dxvk.log` with a plain `std::ofstream`:
  starting the runtime truncates it. R6's worker signals readiness only after the log copy/fallback
  is secure, and bootstrap waits before runtime activation (`loader/proxy/startup.cpp`).
- The fork has no general clean-exit log marker. `src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_context.cpp:945-953`
  logs `RTX: Terminating application` only for its deliberate delayed termination after captures/
  exports finish. FSR `onDestroy`/context-destroyed lines are resource lifecycle messages and do
  not establish a clean process exit. Unmarked sessions remain `unknown`.
- Engine OOM text can be ASCII or UTF-16 LE inside a dump. R6 scans bounded, copied game-root
  dumps in 64 KiB chunks with a 64-byte overlap; it does not load the dump into memory or execute it
  (`loader/core/src/evidence.cpp`, `loader/tests/test_evidence.cpp`).

## R4 start-up, guard and bootstrap review (loader 0.10.1)

Facts behind [ADR 0056](decisions/0056-guard-and-startup-fallbacks.md), read from the PoC's stock
Lua (read-only) unless marked:

- The stock toolgun screen, `gamemodes/sandbox/entities/weapons/gmod_tool/cl_viewscreen.lua`, pushes
  its RT at line 51 and `cam.Start2D()` at 52, calls the tool's `DrawToolScreen` unprotected at 62
  and pops at 71-72: a failing tool leaves both scopes open every frame, outside any guard callback.
- Base `GM:PostDrawViewModel` (`gamemodes/base/gamemode/cl_init.lua:600`) draws the player's hands
  for every weapon with `UseHands` or no script, so quarantining that gamemode method hid the hands.
- The base gamemode defines `PreGamemodeLoaded`, `OnGamemodeLoaded` and `PostGamemodeLoaded`
  (`gamemodes/base/gamemode/shared.lua:233-241`); sandbox's spawn menu and the menubar module create
  themselves on `OnGamemodeLoaded`. Their order relative to `Initialize` was not measured in game; the
  owned payload registers only `Initialize` and `InitPostEntity` callbacks today.
- Reported (GMod wiki, AddCSLuaFile): files in `lua/autorun/` and `lua/autorun/client/` are sent to
  clients without `AddCSLuaFile`, so a host that mounts the companion sends its guard autorun anyway.
- LuaJIT 2.x passes extra arguments through `xpcall(f, handler, ...)`, which the guard now uses to
  avoid a closure and argument table per protected callback.
- The guard's cache file names are 81 characters; in this repository's worktrees the early-guard test
  scratch paths reach 259 characters, so its fixture writer uses extended-length paths.
- This machine has no Node.js. In R4 the main-menu harness ran in the desktop app's browser pane
  through a small `vm`/`fs`/`assert` shim and passed (bootstrap polling ends after 239 retries).

## C13 graphics add-ons and map loading

This is a bounded API/source audit plus controlled baseline work, not a reproduced user crash.
The local record is `out/c13-evidence`: `wiki-api-audit.md`, `addons/addon-audit.md`, native
`findings.md`, and their hash/URL inventories. It covers 17 API families and 43 primary URLs
(41 Facepunch wiki pages, Lua's manual and Microsoft's SEH reference). The focused index has
25 call-site files (12 stock/13 add-on), alongside the broader 228-file add-on inventory. The durable
[API audit snapshot](audits/C13-render-api.md) and [compact provenance](audits/C13-render-api.json)
retain source hashes/URLs without game source code or private paths. These counts do not imply every function or payload
was executed. Of 25 distinct selected add-ons, eight sources were obtained: exact LifeMod, FXAA
and NikNaks archives, plus author-linked RealCSM, GShader Library, Projected Volumetric Light,
Spherical Sky and Outline Shader repositories. Repository snapshots are not asserted to match
current Workshop bytes. The coverage ledger marks 17 selected sources unavailable: QuickBloom/HDR
and 16 of the 22 collection members. Only FXAA and NikNaks have exact collection archives; the
other collection source snapshots do not establish current Workshop-byte identity.

Source exposes concrete compatibility boundaries: RealCSM upgrades eight shadow-target formats
and creates cascaded projected lights; GShader requests shared resolved-depth changes, float
targets/MRT and a DepthWrite material, and installs global/metatable wrappers. These are candidate
native resource paths to isolate, not proof of this user's crash. The official contracts include
[render-target lifetime](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.GetRenderTarget),
[target sizing/format parameters](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.GetRenderTargetEx),
[secondary views](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.RenderView) and
[hook dispatch](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/hook.Call). Stock frame blending uses full-frame
size modes with -1 dimensions; stereoscopy makes two views inside RenderScene; the toolgun can
invoke a custom screen callback inside a caller-owned RT/camera scope. Blanket positive-size,
one-view-per-frame or reset-to-depth-zero policies would break those valid cases.

Native backend audit: the referenced [LUX DX11 README](https://github.com/Akabenko/LUX-Gmod-shaderapidx11/blob/30fb5b1b5ec6db70dea93e4556468cb904dc0a98/README.md)
selects `-shaderapi shaderapidx11`. Remix's [D3D9 SDK path](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/dxvk-remix/blob/main/documentation/RemixSDK.md)
and our native module's `FindD3D9Device`/registration require the Source D3D9 device. Forty-one
bounded installed/fixture PE observations found stock matching graphics-core hashes and a local
DXVK `d3d9.dll`; no DX11 backend was found on the scanned surfaces. No actual DX11-payload live
compatibility or Steam launch-option inspection is claimed. Stock shaderapidx9 SHA-256
`7534cd56738f3f729dab0b88fce7f5fa224898fc15c28021762f3352643f8ca9` imports Direct3DCreate9;
passive REA evidence `ev_868c0082e4c0ba1e112e51c15f3c9920c842f3a82a86695ce68350a8a4ff4853`
is retained locally, with the session closed. DLL presence alone is not an incompatibility test:
DXVK is retained for RTX-off starts and the loader itself uses system DXGI for adapter information.

Loader 0.10.0 now normalizes every explicit shader-API choice in the process command line,
preserving other raw spans and exact rollback. It does not rewrite Steam options or graphics DLLs.
The existing selected-Remix-DLL path/handle identity refusal remains. The early client initializer
view is separate: only a supported stock hash and the enabled catalog-verified owner/V2 guard may
produce the generated owned view, after libraries and before autoruns. This reduces alias-capture
gaps without editing the depot initializer or granting foreign Lua/native code new permissions.
The cache path is `native-loader/presentation/render-guard-<sha>.lua`. The Lua guard additionally
requires `__NATIVELOADER_RTX_GUARD_EARLY`; activation fallback removes its executable read redirect,
and no ordinary late-autorun fallback substitutes for verified early installation.
For the selected `gmod-rtx-remix` runtime, stock/cache failure after catalog verification of a V2
owner raises required-protection failure, disables activation and retains vanilla/hide-RTX fallback.
That requirement does not run before owner/V2 verification or widen trust. A foreign runtime does
not read the initializer/cache through this path; legacy V1 marker failure remains a nonfatal note.

The Lua prototype addresses reserved depth targets, unsupported depth/MRT paths, RenderView
recursion, additional cvar entry points and protected render/loading hook dispatch. Cleanup must
respect each callback's entry state, never call mesh.Abort, and never assume that
depth zero/default render state belongs to it. Recoverable Lua-error containment does not establish
recovery from native access violations, engine fatals or GPU faults. Raw R32F format 27 is valid;
the format check was corrected and the normal/MMDHL target positive control passes. A reserved-name
collision or unsupported MRT/depth feature is a separate capability issue, not proof R32F is invalid.

Current measured baselines are fresh loader-0.9 LifeMod defaults on flatgrass, author-linked
RealCSM with depth format 24/one controller on flatgrass, and GShader/FXAA source inputs on
flatgrass and construct. All load; none reproduces the original failure. The protected-shader2/3
runs activate RTX and record the redirected stock initializer read. The guarded combined
construct-to-flatgrass transition exits zero; combined2 passes ten live assertions including
blocked mat_hdr_level:SetInt, one intentional HUD failure quarantined with RT state restored,
and valid normal/R32F targets. CSM depth-24/one-controller fallback is nonfatal. Two rejected
GShader autoruns remain visible in GMod's reports; this is not full effect compatibility.
Release passes **22 CTests and 294 Python tests (7 skips)**, including 20 early-policy cases,
6 backend cases, 11 targeted command-line cases and 17 unittest cases running 18 actual-source
LuaJIT scenarios. CI builds pinned official LuaJIT and requires it, rather than skipping these
scenarios. CPU tests are separate from the real NVIDIA GPU sessions below.

The actual 998-file GMA reads back against every manifest SHA and matches all preview payloads.
Its construct session passes ten failure/positive controls: reserved RTs, invalid dimensions,
unsupported shader/MRT/depth work, pinned HDR writes, valid normal/R32F targets, one quarantined
HUD failure and restored RT state. Toolgun rendering and spawn-menu open controls pass. Corrupting only its owned
startup cache gives a clean vanilla map load/exit, no RTX patches or executable init redirect,
and preserves the changed cache; the fixture restores its original bytes afterward.

Secure dedicated multiplayer passes with no -insecure, sv_allowcslua 0 and cheats 0. The trusted
RTX payload, RTXDebug and guard load; unrelated local Lua remains excluded and the temporary
catalog API is absent. A normal server-delivered test verifies an unsupported-shader rejection,
one failing HUD callback, continuing healthy callbacks and restored RT state with zero cleanup
errors. It records installation="verified multiplayer bootstrap", with the early flag false.
This is a later readiness boundary, not protection before the remote server's autoruns.

Earlier controlled baselines load LifeMod defaults, CSM depth24/one controller and GShader/FXAA.
The guarded combined construct-to-flatgrass transition and explicit DX11-to-D3D9 process choice
pass. RTX-off loads/exits normally with the guard absent. Steam depot verification passes.

The original user crash was not reproduced with fresh defaults. Exact QuickBloom/HDR source and
sixteen collection members were unavailable; author-linked repositories are distinguished from
exact Workshop archives. Unsupported shader effects can be disabled or quarantined while the
map loads; this does not promise their original appearance or recovery from native/GPU faults.
Earlier aliases, later API replacements, unknown native state and already-completed camera/clip/
matrix pops remain explicit limits. Multiplayer installation is later than server autoruns.

The secure test first exposed an actual gap: a read hit came from menu initialization while
the remote client guard was absent. Loaded-44/errors-empty was not guard-execution evidence.
The final private-environment path and cached-dispatcher HUD fault test establish later client installation.
The late route wraps render registrations because replacing hook.Call alone left the engine
invoking an earlier dispatcher. Loading callback identities remain intact for payload replay.
No runtime/native bridge rebuild was needed; the renderer/native fixes remain unchanged.

## Oversized Airi skinning groups (item 24)

Read-only inspection of Workshop 3830665593, VRChat Airi(InuinuBone), identifies the reported
40,509 vertices as the clothing-fur mesh in both `models/pm/airi_inuinubone_pm.mdl` and
`models/npc/airi_inuinubone_npc.mdl`. The source archive `gmpublisher.gma` is 721,989,777 bytes,
SHA-256 `d97ae9d34750e5ad86bcbd95cbd03c12dd1b009f6a5323265e8389ad202bf558`.
Each model has 233 bones, 25 meshes, one compiled LOD and 329,678 LOD0 source vertices.

The matching studiorender.dll, SHA-256
`1dcb270dc9fa7186acd7ae2f66207416412ba1b7c606d7e65bf923d7152ce4b6`, contains the warning.
Independent native inspection locates `R_StudioDrawDynamicMesh` at preferred address 0x18000FA20
and its vertex-count comparison at 0x18000FB3A: groups below 0x8000 continue; groups at or above
32,768 warn and return zero. This is a per-group software draw limit, not a total-model limit.
Hiding the warning alone would retain the skipped draw. The direct hardware helper also has a
software fallback, without the dynamic entry's equivalent capacity precheck. The later reported
62,049-vertex fatal against a 32,768-vertex buffer therefore required protecting both entries.

| Bodypart / mesh ID | MDL source vertices | VTX group vertices | Strips | Material variants |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Hair / 4 | 61,896 | 62,049 | 3 | Hair, Black, Gray, Brown, Blue, Pink, Green |
| Clothes / 7 | 40,509 | 40,509 | 1 | Fuzz, Fuzz_B |
| Shoes(L) / 19 | 33,422 | 33,422 | 1 | Shoes, Shoes_W |
| Shoes(R) / 20 | 33,422 | 33,422 | 1 | Shoes, Shoes_W |

All four groups occur in both player and NPC models, have compiled `STRIPGROUP_IS_HWSKINNED`
data (flag 0x02) and zero MDL flexes. Hair's extra VTX vertices are palette duplicates; its
original-mesh IDs cover exactly the 61,896 source vertices. Its three strips have 53, 53 and 41
bone palette changes. Each shoe uses four distinct bones. The separate arms model totals 37,757
vertices, but its largest group is 14,754, making it a useful control for group-based detection.

Clothing bodypart 5, submodel `Clothes.smd`, mesh 0/global ID 7 uses Fuzz for skins 0–7 and Fuzz_B
for skins 8–15. Its single strip has 169,398 indices/56,466 triangles and 25 palette changes.
There are 8,219 one-bone, 24,313 two-bone and 7,977 three-bone vertices; every referenced bone
exists and weights normalize within 0.001. Drawing without skinning would lose valid weighted
deformation. Both Fuzz materials are VertexLitGeneric without software-skin directives, proxies
or fallbacks. The archive has dx90.vtx data and no sw.vtx; that alone does not rule out a runtime
software fallback. Runtime material flags/cvar state have not yet been measured by this asset pass.

MDL/VVD/VTX entry CRCs, checksums, vertex ranges, bone ranges/counts and weight sums pass. The
read-only parser did not execute add-on code or extract textures. Detailed evidence is in the
main checkout's `out/oversized-skinning-evidence/asset-findings.md`, `model-inventory.json`,
`mesh-summary.txt` and `validation.json`. REA warning/function references are
`ev_4068803caf065f4700651d539889e94440552386c645bf4ccc14715ac3ce9006`,
`ev_9dd106d75194ea64a06745f6cf72926983e7b756e91521a967a6ef699ce1360d` and
`ev_d046b0940e7e634e8f2c8a5d20621e9fe39d7eb853c7fb667e15c719bc73df7e`.
The implementation is native local commit `b23c58fa72e8ac2d9a7dfb0bcad8b03fe247edbe`; the final
gmcl_RTXFixesBinary_win64.dll SHA-256 is
`5e626e34f412cd55e93a485cd1d777794b339a0cb7a5082935454b72fbc72db7`.
The [source notice and pins](../packages/fixes/licenses/oversized-skinning/Source.md) include the
complete changed source, generated projects, patches and GPL licence. They ship through the short
add-on path `remixbinary/src/hw`; a deeper source path exceeded Windows staging limits.

The automatic path applies only to already hardware-skinned, non-flex groups of at least 32,768
vertices. Creation-time VTX validation requires every strip to assign every hardware bone slot it
uses. A certificate plus runtime strip-data fingerprint rejects unknown/changed groups; cached
palettes from other groups cannot prove missing assignments. The bounded certificate implementation
starts at source/HardwareSkinningHooks.cpp:2175 in the shipped source. At DrawIndexedPrimitive,
D3DCOLOR blend indices use a borrowed UBYTE4 declaration only when needed; a 16-entry cache holds
original/converted COM references and releases them at shutdown. Palette, blend, config, material,
group and bookkeeping state are restored with __finally, as is the original declaration.

Both dynamic and direct entries now borrow that scope, preserving all nine arguments. A
thread-local same-group marker prevents dynamic-to-direct re-entry from wrapping twice. An
oversized group with unknown static-fallback config38 bit 0x08 is skipped safely. Existing
user-forced hardware draws also need the scope for smaller non-flex, multi-bone groups inside
RenderFinal when the legacy r_hwskin_setbones predicate selects them (mode 1 or matching bone
count). Otherwise Source can CPU-pose a small group while native indexed upload transforms it
again. Ordinary force0 draws, rigid single-bone props, flex and forced-eye paths remain unchanged.
Complete certificates remain mandatory only for oversized groups. Small user-forced groups keep
their existing remap/cache fallback and diagnostic mode selection; no stored cvar is changed.

Baseline PM at `r_forcehwskin 0`/`mat_softwareskin 1`, without insecure, repeated all four warnings
and lacked hair/shoes. The dynamic-only 0d4 prototype passed initial PM checks but missed the
direct-entry fatal; it is superseded. The static-only 034 intermediate left smaller body meshes
invisible under force1 and is also superseded. The 357 preview restored force1 PM skins 0/8,
full body, hair, boots and visible arms without a fatal, then exited zero. Final 5e626e34 adds
minor route/debug guards and passes cold default0 NPC skins 0/8 plus arms (`complete-default`).
The actual final GMA also passes force1 PM skins 0/8 with full body and arms visible, no errors
and exit zero (`complete-packaged`). Both the software warning and the later direct-fallback
fatal are addressed; earlier dynamic-only/static-only passes are not the final acceptance record.

An earlier packaged 0d4 client PID 3752 passed secure multiplayer with cslua/cheats off, rendering
configuration apply/restore, denied unsafe commands, hands and the 233-bone Airi rendered. Content
was mounted by normal server-approved game.MountGMA; no other add-on Lua was force-loaded. This
earlier result does not establish final-DLL multiplayer acceptance, which remains pending.

The final standalone policy CTest passes with Release /UNDEBUG assertions, including user-mode
and unsupported-mode cases. Final `final-tests.log` passes 20 CTests/277 Python tests (7 skips).
Reviewed GMA `0.0.0-dev.20261031090406+335c6f09` contains 998 files/1,837,514,493 bytes, payload digest
`13f303982ed43e47bccf09847186bd3bb43477cb65dbbcb1c5534117cbae4ba3`.
Readback matches the final DLL and corresponding source: 28 changes, no files removed and no user
assets included. Final-DLL multiplayer (client PID 18232), CI and publication remain pending. See
[ADR 0053](decisions/0053-oversized-hardware-skinning.md).

## Scoped RTX multiplayer loading (loader 0.9.0)

The game has separate menu and client Lua states. The menu's `require("nlrtxclient")` must resolve
`gmsv_nlrtxclient_win64.dll`, despite the helper initializing client rendering scripts. The initial
`gmcl_` filename did not load from the menu; native module lookup inspection established that the
menu uses the non-client prefix. The `gmsv_` name does not make this a dedicated-server initializer:
`loader/client/module.cpp` explicitly requires `MENU_DLL`, obtains the client state through
`LUASHARED003`, waits for that state's readiness and verifies the active owned runtime.

`loader/client/catalog.cpp:54` prepares the source snapshot from an enabled config and committed
deployment. The package identity is exactly `gmod-rtx-remix`; local/dev sources must match their
respective native allowlists, and Workshop sources must be the configured distribution item
3829070317 under `workshop/content/4000`. Each owned module/script must still match its journaled
size and SHA-256, with unsafe paths, links, case collisions and oversized/NUL source refused.
Other owners cannot supply a replacement at the same virtual Lua path. Generic `rtx_agent` and
Hotloader debug-source execution are excluded. The temporary native callbacks read catalog keys,
not arbitrary paths or source text.

Omitting the existing renderer fixes caused a prototype startup crash. The secure-launch exception
therefore covers only the seven existing rendering recipes in `tools/package_fixes.py:58`, grouped
as 2 engine, 3 shader API, 1 material-system and 1 data-cache fixes. The classifier at
`loader/client/catalog.cpp:41` binds the exact owner, module, patch name, find bytes, offset,
replacement and order. Mutated, extra, incomplete or reordered groups fail classification. Config
`patch_sets.allow_rtx_render_patches: false` disables the exception; the general
`patch_sets.require_insecure` default remains true. See
[ADR 0052](decisions/0052-scoped-rtx-multiplayer-bootstrap.md).

Two pre-fix client crashes reached `studiorender+0x5D353` on a queued worker with a null hardware
LOD array. The late cl_rtx.lua initial/final MDLCache flush could invalidate static-prop hardware
data after the world was active. The bootstrap now sets `NATIVELOADER_VERIFIED_MULTIPLAYER` only
inside owned environments, and the GPL add-on skips those late flushes. Normal early loading
retains both reloads. Actual-section timer/hook tests cover normal nil/false flags, convar retries,
and verified matching/mismatched/missing convars with zero flushes. Crash analysis is retained in
`out/debug-crash-analysis/findings.md`. The player-shadow proxy also snapshots source bones before
its callback, validates destination bones and avoids accumulating its offset; two body cases pass.

Some bundled clients request catalog, scene-sharing, motion or material-store channels that a
vanilla remote server never pools. The scoped net adapter shares drop state across owned source
environments, suppresses writes/sends for those missing channels and records their names. The
engine's global net table and registered-channel errors/returns stay intact. This prevents client
initialization errors; server-dependent tool features still require matching server add-ons.

Offline evidence: 16 catalog cases, 7 config cases and the actual Lua bootstrap/reload suite's
6 tests/14 scenarios pass. A `gmod.exe -dedicated` prototype was not counted as dedicated-server
proof. Prototype 7 client PID 8544 subsequently joined genuine 64-bit dedicated PID 78088, with
VAC secure mode active, `sv_lan 0`, a password-protected loopback connection, `sv_allowcslua 0`,
cheats off and no client `-insecure`. It completed 44 autoruns with no payload errors, six absent
server channels recorded, no temporary API global and an unrelated local Lua fixture still blocked.
Reconnect and gm_construct -> gm_flatgrass -> gm_construct passed in the same client process;
the Source JPEG at `out/mpc/garrysmod/screenshots/nl_mp_construct.jpg` records the rendered world
and hands. RTXDebug 0.2 reports connected/in-game client and menu realms, no server realm,
successful rendering SetConfig/restore with unchanged config-file hashes, and refused Lua.Eval and
Engine.SetConVar attempts to enable client Lua. Evidence is under `out/multiplayer-evidence/probe7*`.
This controlled session is not a universal VAC/server-policy guarantee. Final full-suite, package
readback and publication results remain pending.

RTXDebug 0.2.0 took "single-player" for its developer mutation gate from the client realm's Lua
`game.SinglePlayer`, which a remote server's client scripts can replace; the server also replicates
`sv_cheats`. 0.2.1 (R4) asks the engine instead. In the vanilla x64 engine.dll (5707088 bytes,
SHA-256 d8f74db72412ffa91c1f01a633d108331145d0a7dff6cffabe1b67ed5abe4fcb), RTTI finds one
`CEngineClient` vtable (RVA 0x39d048) and one `CNetChan` vtable (RVA 0x3e0150). Their slots match
sourcesdk-minimal's `cdll_int.h` and `inetchannelinfo.h`: `CEngineClient` 21 `GetMaxClients` and 12
`GetLocalPlayer` read client-state fields, 26 `IsInGame` and 27 `IsConnected` compare the signon
state with 6 and 2, 72 `GetNetChannelInfo` returns the client state's channel pointer, 76
`IsPlayingDemo` and 78 `IsPlayingTimeDemo` call the demo player at vtable offsets 0x30 and 0x40, and
106 is `ClientCmd_Unrestricted`. `CNetChan` slots 0-9 match in order. Slots 1 `GetAddress` and 6
`IsLoopback` both use the remote address at +0xC4, and `netadr_t::IsLoopback` is only
`type == NA_LOOPBACK` (1), the engine's in-process loopback buffers: a connection to 127.0.0.1 or a
LAN server is not loopback. Slot 8 `IsPlayback` is the same folded function as `IsPlayingDemo`. The
header's last declarations do not match (slot 150, declared `IsDedicatedServer`, takes five
arguments); RTXDebug does not call them. `Engine.World` reported `max_clients` 8 in probe 7's
dedicated session and 1 in single-player (`out/multiplayer-evidence/probe7/debug-checks.json`,
`out/multiplayer-evidence/singleplayer/checks.json`).

## Startup text and main-menu identity (requests 15 and 23)

The launch text was hard-coded in runtime src/dxvk/imgui/dxvk_imgui_splash.cpp:88 and referred to
Xenthio. It now reads companion/presentation/startup_message*.txt from the deployed data
folder and uses literal text rendering. The runtime font atlas adds the selected template's glyphs.

The stock control.Menu.js exposes gScope.Version/Branch through UpdateVersion and InGame through
SetInGame. The [menu realm](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/States) is separate from normal client
add-ons. Loader presentation.cpp appends the local panel through the existing exact-read mechanism.
diagnostics.cpp reads system descriptors and hashes the installed bootstrap; package hashes come
from the committed generation's manifest_sha256, avoiding a self-referential package hash or a
startup rehash of the entire runtime. The UI never reads console logs or displays source paths.

## Imported normals and navigation (requests 17, 19/19.1 and 20)

Hotloader materials.lua returns engine-safe paths from Entity:GetMaterials; original names are in
rig.materials[].name. AME sh_15_mmd.lua now resolves labels separately, including static-prop cache
names. Paths remain rule/profile identities. cl_76_rtx_editor.lua OnWorkspaceChanged previously
preferred SourceDisplaySelected over Selected, retaining the stale Source row. It now follows the
current RTX row on entry and maps the Source row to CanonicalSlot on return.

The motion importer's cl_menu.lua:5862 exposes MMDVMDNPC.OpenMotionManager; the creation tab calls
that existing entry point. The fixes' source/remixapi/remixapi.cpp:1111 GetConfigVariable reads
rtx.conf rather than live layers, so replacing the saved smooth-normal set would be unsafe.
Native rtx_model_layers.h owns a separate NoSave set, joined on D3D9, cached-draw and external
submission paths. Existing rtx_scene_manager.cpp:1858 dispatches area-weighted geometry normals;
no shader source or ABI changes are needed. Tags affect all draws sharing a captured texture.

## Player bodies and first-person arms (2026-10-30)

- The shipped runtime's InstanceManager::createViewModelInstances explicitly zeroed every candidate
  mask and returned when PlayerModel::enableInPrimarySpace was true (rtx_instance_manager.cpp,
  previous lines 1755-1763). GMod continued issuing view-model/hand draws, but screenshots lost the
  entire view model. Removing that branch retains ViewModel::enable and normal camera correction.
- The classic defaults had 549 player texture hashes and three body hashes. The Lua categorizer
  also tagged original player textures with unique_hashes=0, which the classic client defaults use.
  Texture categories apply to all matching geometry, including other players, NPCs and ragdolls.
- Existing RTX_c configuration also contains 529 player texture hashes in rtx.conf and four in
  user.conf. Clean defaults alone do not remove those stronger saved tags. The integration clears
  only player bits for observed original player/hand/ragdoll hashes in memory, preserving files and
  unrelated flags. Native RemoveHashCategory only removes categories in its own cache, so file-only
  tags need temporary local bookkeeping before their targeted removal.
- The former body proxy changed LocalPlayer's bone 0, ignored Z in the default angle mode, and
  created nested body models plus an independently duplicated weapon proxy. The new proxy only
  adjusts its own final render bone matrices, in world Z for either offset mode.
- [render.ReadPixel](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.ReadPixel) reads the current captured
  target. One sampled blue channel is inverted for a guaranteed private texture, while
  [OverrideAlphaWriteEnable](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/render.OverrideAlphaWriteEnable)
  preserves the copied alpha. Merely blending a white pixel did not change an already-white texel.
- The runtime recipe verified the seven-patch tree, NVAPI/RTXDI settings and DLSS/SHARC clones.
  Only rtx_instance_manager.cpp changed; an incremental meson compile -j 2 reused the verified shader
  stamp. The resulting DLL SHA-256 is ca3ce8dc21f052bf6026c74b776c8d2e4186c33e42023e29f2776852e865cefc.
  Use Windows PowerShell 5.1 for build_runtime.ps1 -Verify: restoring absent Git environment values
  as empty strings under the current PowerShell/.NET host makes later Git worktree commands fail.

## Prior RTXLauncher installations (2026-10-30)

- [Xenthio fixes](https://github.com/Xenthio/garrys-mod-rtx-remixed) nightly aaefa35c5da3156e3f7352fbb4ac734361affed8
  and [RTXLauncher](https://github.com/Xenthio/RTXLauncher) 7779fc474d2cc4c73c8b02f031cc239159e9e8e4
  identify the tested layout. QuickInstall flattens the runtime ZIP's .trex contents into bin/win64,
  applies seven x64 SourceRTXTweaks edits across four DLLs, then extracts the fixes.
- Runtime ZIP SHA-256: 997747227bfd809434d3b264c2fa9fa0da3cd63773a2dfadabe90e5b1eceb12c;
  fixes ZIP: 2f32286bde9af91d748b44fefaa09408c0e4c1bf9690667b4c1d4eb95f0913f4.
  The 265,998,848-byte old runtime exports remixapi_InitializeLibrary; plain DXVK is not a match.
  Sparse detection reads at most 32 MiB, caches 128 KiB and never executes that DLL.
- The fixes overwrite stdshader_dx6.dll and five stock Lua/image files without preserving originals.
  Four native patches have backup_patches_<timestamp>/bin/win64 originals. steam.inf is not a safe
  binary build identity. Recovery uses exact old/stock hashes, recorded in legacy_stock_data.h from
  Steam depots 4001/7488132547021413298 and 4002/7341198560151933050, build 26229091.
- Fresh fixture: 2,877 verified stock files, then 192 runtime files, 387 fixes entries and four
  patched DLLs. Independent depot verification finds exactly ten altered files, zero missing or
  unverified files. Seven sentinels cover protected user files and an obsolete addon Lua file.
  Full local evidence is out/legacy-research/FIXTURE-HANDOFF.md and fixture-state.json.
- The launcher's optional MaterialSystemFallbackPatch guard was run in an isolated .NET probe:
  Unsupported, InitializeShader counter initialization site not found. It leaves these bytes
  unchanged, matching its normal warning/skip behavior. No downloaded Python code was executed.
- Links (2026-10-31, RTXLauncher 7779fc4 read locally): Mount HL2 RTX builds
  garrysmod/addons/mount-hl2rtx/{models,materials,maps} as real folders whose entries are file and
  directory symbolic links into Half-Life 2 RTX (Hl2RtxMountService.cs BuildMergedDirectory,
  File.CreateSymbolicLink :365, Directory.CreateSymbolicLink :375), next to
  .rtxlauncher-hl2rtx-overlay.json, and adds entries to garrysmod/cfg/mount.cfg. A new launcher
  install (GarrysModInstallService.cs:80-158) links the VPKs, sourceengine, platform and
  garrysmod/{saves,dupes,demos,settings,cache,materials,models,maps,screenshots,videos,download};
  none of those is a path the migration catalogs. mount-hl2rtx is one of its five add-on roots.
- MSVC std::filesystem::absolute (GetFullPathNameW) resolves "." and ".." before a check of the
  result could see them, so a path must be checked as given. Iterating "H:\a" yields "H:" first,
  and stat("H:") reads drive H's current folder, not its root; start link checks at root_path().
- Re-hashing a freshly staged payload before each move (loader 0.8.0, every step): 1.5 GiB in
  0.75 s, 2.0 GiB/s (CNG SHA-256, 1 MiB reads, page cache warm; Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which has SHA
  extensions; other games running; 2026-10-31). The RTX package is about 1.75 GB (files.json:
  runtime 1,204 MB, fixes 433 MB, model-hotloader 83 MB, the rest 30 MB), so about 0.85 s at every
  update here, and several seconds on a CPU without SHA extensions or once the staged files have
  left the cache (estimate). The check now covers the migration's moves only.

Facts the design rests on, with where they came from, so nobody has to dig them up again. Gathered
2026-10-27 unless a section says otherwise. "Verified" = checked directly (file read, PE parse,
hash); "reported" = from a code-reading pass over the named repo, not re-checked line by line.
External paths are local checkouts under `H:\BACKUP_20260815\Modding\` (see [ENVIRONMENT.md](ENVIRONMENT.md)).

## 1. How GMod x64 loads DLLs (verified)

- PE imports (`tools/diag/pe_imports.py` on build 26229091):
  - `bin\win64\gmod.exe`: `USER32, KERNEL32, ADVAPI32, ole32, WINMM, dbghelp`; delay-load `libcef`.
  - `launcher.dll` adds `WSOCK32`; `engine.dll` adds `WININET`; `client.dll` adds `CRYPT32`.
  - `shaderapidx9.dll`: `d3d9.dll`, `d3dx9_42.dll` (static).
  - The root `gmod.exe` is a small 32-bit launcher (`SHLWAPI`, `KERNEL32` only).
- KnownDLLs on this machine do **not** include `winmm`, `dbghelp`, `wsock32`, `wininet`, `crypt32`,
  `d3d9` or `version`, so for those names the copy in `bin\win64` (the application folder) wins.
- Of the executables in a vanilla `bin\win64`, only `gmod.exe` imports `WINMM`/`dbghelp` directly;
  the tools (hlmv, studiomdl, vbsp, ...) load it through `tier0.dll`. The proxy must therefore
  check its host process.
- Vanilla `bin\win64` contains no `d3d9.dll`, `winmm.dll`, `dbghelp.dll`, `version.dll` or
  `vulkan-1.dll` (checked on the PoC copy).
- Windows binds an import to an already-loaded module of the same base name regardless of folder
  (documented search-order behaviour); M4 confirms it for `d3d9.dll` in practice.

## 2. RTX Remix runtime (fork `dxvk-remix-gmod`, verified unless marked)

- Size of the runtime file set in `GarrysMod_RTX_c\bin\win64`: 40 DLL/EXE files, about 928 MB, plus
  `usd\` (150 files, about 5 MB). Biggest: `d3d9.dll` 323 MB, `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` 254 MB,
  `nvrtc64_130_0.dll` 97 MB, `libxess.dll` 74 MB, `nvngx_dlss.dll` 56 MB, `nvngx_dlssd.dll` 46 MB.
- `d3d9.dll` static imports include `usd_*.dll`, `NRC_Vulkan.dll`, `rtxio.dll`,
  `GFSDK_Aftermath_Lib.x64.dll`, `NvLowLatencyVk.dll`, `libxess.dll`, `vulkan-1.dll`, `dbghelp`,
  `VERSION`, `WINHTTP` and the **VC++ 2015+ runtime** (`MSVCP140`, `VCRUNTIME140`, `VCRUNTIME140_1`);
  delay-load `amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll`. Exports: 116, including the D3D9 set and `remixapi_*`
  (with the fork's `remixapi_imgui_*`, persistent instances, game values).
- Config layers (`src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_option_layer.cpp:666-746`): `dxvk.conf` < built-in app
  defaults < `rtx.conf` < base-game-mod `rtx.conf` < programmatic layers < `user.conf`.
  `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE` and `DXVK_RTX_CONFIG_FILE` take comma-separated lists (the last `rtx.conf`
  layer is the one the UI saves to); `user.conf` has no environment override and is opened relative
  to the working directory (`rtx_option_constants.h:115-124`). Reported: a per-user layer
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA\RTXRemix\user_settings\<hash>.conf` is also read. (Corrected in section 19:
  that file holds only first-use and crash-report flags, and is not an option layer.)
- `rtx-remix\{mods,captures,logs}` default to `./rtx-remix/...` made absolute when `d3d9.dll`
  loads, i.e. relative to the working directory, overridable with `DEFAULT_MODS_DIR`,
  `DXVK_CAPTURE_PATH`, `DXVK_LOG_PATH` (`src/util/util_filesys.h:63-65`, `util_filesys.cpp:106-147`).
- DLSS (NGX) feature DLLs are searched in the folder of `d3d9.dll` (`rtx_ngx_wrapper.cpp:165-191`,
  `env::getDllDirectory()`); NRD is located through the module's own path (`rtx_nrd_context.cpp:62`);
  reported: USD plugins resolve from `d3d9.dll`'s folder (`rtx_mod_usd.cpp:2495-2500`).
- GMod is launched with the game root as working directory, which is where `rtx.conf`, `dxvk.conf`,
  `user.conf`, `imgui.ini` and `rtx-remix\` live in `GarrysMod_RTX_c`.

## 3. RTX fixes (`garrys-mod-rtx-remixed`, GPL-2.0)

- Verified: `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary` gets the Remix API through
  `remix::lib::loadRemixDllAndInitialize(L"d3d9.dll")`, which first calls `LoadLibraryW("d3d9.dll")`
  and so accepts an already-loaded runtime (`public/include/remix/remix_c.h:1143-1147`), then falls
  back to `LoadLibraryExW`/`SetDllDirectoryW` variants.
- Verified: its shaderapidx9 and materialsystem patch sets are disabled in code with
  "these don't apply properly" (`source/culling_fixes.cpp:275-277`).
- Reported: requires Remix API 0.1000.1 (fork only; stock NVIDIA runtimes reject it); applies 8
  in-memory engine/client culling patches toggled by `rtx_patch_*` convars, ported from
  SourceRTXTweaks `patches64` (`source/culling_patches.cpp:81-347`); hooks studiorender, datacache,
  filesystem and D3D9 via MinHook and signature scans; the D3D9 device pointer comes from a
  shaderapidx9 signature; `"d3d9.dll"` is hard-coded in several places; game root = exe path minus
  three components.
- Reported: the Lua side (`garrysmod/addons/remixbinary`) bails out in multiplayer unless the
  binary module is installed, and loads it with `require("RTXFixesBinary")`.
- Reported: the RTX stack also needs root `rtx.conf`/`dxvk.conf`, `rtx-remix\mods\{base_mod,
  ~gmod_topbr, rtx_water, gm_poolrooms_rtx}`, a replacement `bin\win64\stdshader_dx6.dll`
  (fixed-function ports of spritecard, eyes, wireframe and water shaders), and cvars in
  `garrysmod\cfg\autoexec.cfg` (`mat_disable_d3d9ex 1`, `r_shadows 0`, `mat_softwareskin 1`,
  `r_novis 1`, ...).
- Reported: `source/startup_assets` is an earlier `d3d9.dll` proxy that reads GMA v3 and finds
  Workshop items without the Steam API (registry, `libraryfolders.vdf`,
  `ugc/4000_subscriptions.vdf`, `appworkshop_4000.acf`). Reference for behaviour only (licence).

## 4. RTXLauncher (reported)

- Installs into a separate copy of GMod (files copied, big folders symlinked; needs admin or
  Developer Mode). The runtime comes from `SheepyLord/dxvk-remix-gmod` GitHub releases (asset
  `*-gmod.zip`, extracted flat into `bin\win64`); the fixes from the `garrys-mod-rtx-remixed`
  nightly zip, extracted into the game root.
- On-disk binary patches from `applypatch.py` (`patches64` from `sambow23/SourceRTXTweaks`):
  hex signatures with `??` wildcards that must match exactly once, length-preserving; plus
  `MaterialSystemFallbackPatch` (x64 only), which caps recursive `$fallbackmaterial` loads.
- Launches `bin\win64\gmod.exe -game garrysmod -console -dxlevel 90 +mat_disable_d3d9ex 1 -nod3d9ex
  -windowed -noborder -noworkshop` with the working directory at the copy's root.
- Updates break because copied binaries go stale against updated VPKs, signatures drift, and
  "update install" can overwrite the fixes' `stdshader_dx6.dll`.

## 5. Workshop and GMA facts (verified)

- Installed items, census of all 759 item folders under `steamapps\workshop\content\4000\<id>\`:
  672 hold one plain GMAD `<name>.gma`; 81 hold an LZMA-wrapped `<hash>_legacy.bin` (older
  uploads; all 81 start with the LZMA properties byte `0x5D`); 6 hold loose files only. The largest
  item is 3.2 GB. `nlctl scan` (M2) parsed all 672 `.gma` indexes, 98,656 entries, in 2.8 s with no
  errors. (An earlier sample of 400 `*.gma`/`*.bin` files, "358 GMAD, 42 LZMA", mixed the two kinds.)
- The 81 `*_legacy.bin` files: LZMA-alone header with properties `0x5D` (lc 3, lp 0, pb 2), 16 MiB
  (19 files) or 32 MiB (62) dictionaries, size always declared (largest 376 MB; 4.4 GB decoded from
  1.5 GB in total). Every file ends with an **8-byte GMod footer** after the LZMA stream: the
  decompressed size as a 32-bit little-endian value, then the magic `0xBEEFCACE` (Bootil's writer).
  `tools/gmapack/gmapack.py` treats those 8 bytes as trailing data, so it cannot read any installed
  legacy item; `nl_core` accepts the footer only when it matches exactly.
- **The archive CRC trailer is optional in practice:** 19 of the 81 legacy items (GMAD v3,
  uploaded 2012-2019) end right after their last file, without the 4-byte CRC, and GMod mounts them.
  One legacy item (1136617425) has a matching CRC trailer followed by four zero bytes of padding.
- `nlctl scan` over all 753 installed archives (2026-10-27): every one parses (672 plain, 81 LZMA,
  104,847 file entries); 19 without trailer, 1 with trailing bytes. `nlctl verify` (Release) over
  all 81 legacy items decoded 4.4 GB in 66 s: 6,191 file CRCs and every footer match; the only
  finding is the padded item above.
- `steamapps\workshop\appworkshop_4000.acf` records per item `size`, `timeupdated` and `manifest`.
  What happens to it when the user subscribes and unsubscribes: section 22.
- `garrysmod\cfg\addonnomount.txt` lists the Workshop ids the user disabled.
- `gmad.exe` only packs whitelisted file types (`.dll`/`.exe` are not); the GMod wiki lists
  DLL and EXE files as restricted for Workshop items. Whether `gmpublish` or the Workshop rejects a
  `.gma` built with other tools is untested (M6).
- GMod launch options `-noworkshop` and `-noaddons` disable Workshop and folder addons for a session.

## 6. Steam depot manifests (verified)

- Cached at `<Steam>\depotcache\<depot>_<manifest>.manifest`; the installed ids are under
  `InstalledDepots` in `steamapps\appmanifest_<appid>.acf`.
- Binary layout: `uint32 0x71F617D0`, `uint32 length`, protobuf `ContentManifestPayload`
  (field 1 = file mapping: 1 filename, 2 size, 3 flags, 5 SHA-1 of content, 6 chunks), then
  `0x1F4812BE` + metadata (1 depot id, 2 manifest id, 4 filenames encrypted). A signature block
  (`0x1B81B817`) and an end marker (`0x32C415AB`) follow, per SteamKit2; our parser does not read
  them. GMod's manifests have plaintext filenames (backslash-separated).
- Flags used: 0x1 user config, 0x40 directory, 0x200 symlink.
- Result on 2026-10-27: 2,877 of 2,878 depot files in the field install matched; the exception was
  the user-config `autoexec.cfg`.

## 7. M1 bootstrap measurements (2026-10-27, Codex)

- Export source: `C:\Windows\System32\winmm.dll`, file version
  `10.0.26100.8875 (WinBuild.160101.0800)`, on Windows build **26300.9711**, display version 26H2
  (registry `CurrentBuild`, `UBR`, `DisplayVersion`; the legacy `ProductName` says Windows 10 Pro).
  The standard-library generator measured **181 populated ordinals**, **180 names**, and **one
  ordinal-only export** (ordinal 2). Inventory: `loader/proxy/generated/exports.json`; generation
  and build-time coverage check: `loader/proxy/generate_exports.py`.
- Independent initial C++ test: `covered 181 system ordinals and 180 names`; forwarding calls
  `timeGetTime`, `timeBeginPeriod(1)`, `timeEndPeriod(1)`, `waveOutGetNumDevs` and
  `mmsystemGetVersion` passed with distinct system/proxy module handles. The initial synthetic
  `gmod.exe` test also passed its log-before-main and absent-engine/shader-API/D3D9 assertions.
  This is synthetic-host evidence, not an enabled PoC result. Test source:
  `loader/proxy/tests/test_proxy.cpp`.
- Debug and Release proxy imports measured by `py -3.12 tools/diag/pe_imports.py`: **KERNEL32.dll
  only**, no static/delay VC++ runtime DLL imports. CMake's static CRT and MASM leaf jumps suffice.
  Python on PATH is now Miniconda 3.14.6 (without `pefile`); the existing `py -3.12` installation
  has `pefile`. No packages were downloaded or installed.
- Baseline PoC map launch (PID 20836, Steam running) reached this ordered sequence:
  `Map: gm_construct`, `Clientside Lua startup!`, joystick initialization,
  `Redownloading all lightmaps`, `Thumbs: 58711 => 58770`. The smoke test requires the map and
  client-Lua markers, then gives post-map output three seconds to flush
  (`tools/smoke_test.ps1`, `Invoke-GameRun`). It normalises only formatting and the numeric
  thumbnail allocation counters (`Normalise-Console`). This strict comparison still needs an
  enabled PoC run; do not assume additional varying lines are harmless.
- PoC `vpk.exe` and `bspzip.exe` statically import `tier0.dll`; PoC `tier0.dll` imports `WINMM.dll`
  (`py -3.12 tools/diag/pe_imports.py` on those three files). No-argument baseline runs exit by
  themselves with codes **1** and **-1**, respectively. Raw stdout/stderr are retained under
  `out/baseline/`; enabled comparisons remain pending.
- Windows Defender blocked the initial Debug proxy at 18:09 local time as
  **Trojan:Win32/Bearfoos.A!ml**, threat id **2147731250**. Subsequent load/copy tests failed with
  Windows' virus/potentially-unwanted-software error. Evidence: `Get-MpThreatDetection` resources
  named the Debug build and the `nl-proxy-测试-*` fixture copies; `Get-MpThreat` reported it active.
  The detection needs human review before further native runtime validation; no antivirus
  configuration was changed. See [M1-report.md](handover/M1-report.md).
- Resumed after the user reported excluding the main checkout: Release passed **11/14** proxy
  cases (including entry timing and all off switches) before fresh detections blocked its remaining
  fixtures and removed the Release DLL in the sibling M1 worktree. Debug passed 7/14; both full
  suites still failed. `0xc0000906` is `STATUS_VIRUS_INFECTED` (installed Windows SDK
  `shared/ntstatus.h:11558`). The new detections name the sibling `!NVIDIA-RTX-Remix-M1` and
  `%TEMP%/nl-proxy-测试-*`, outside the main checkout path the user named. Full logs:
  `out/m1-full-debug-tests.txt`, `out/m1-full-release-tests.txt`.

## 8. M1 final validation and Chromium roles (2026-10-27, Codex)

- Per the user's requested output root, the active `m1-bootstrap` worktree is now
  `H:\BACKUP_20260815\Modding\!NVIDIA-RTX-Remix\out\worktrees\m1-bootstrap`. All builds, installer
  fixtures, host fixtures and evidence stay below it. The earlier sibling worktree/build was
  removed. Seven hash-verified legacy host executables were moved from `%TEMP%` to
  `out/prior-validation/legacy-fixtures` (SHA-256
  `5AA6BAD58029EF96C6DC4936B769C5522BD51094F8EC23658880AA860AB78FF4`), preserving them after
  automatic approval review rejected deletion. No generated executable remains in those temp roots.
- GMod's Chromium processes reuse **the same `bin\win64\gmod.exe`**, with roles such as
  `--type=utility --utility-sub-type=network.mojom.NetworkService`. They do not inherit the parent's
  `-nonativeloader` switch. The first real smoke run showed a helper PID replacing the main log
  (`out/smoke/20261028T012617409Z/off-command.loader.log`). A path-only host gate therefore lets a
  helper run the bootstrap even when the main launch is disabled.
- Fixed by treating `--type=value` / `--type value` roles as pure pass-through, using the same
  allocation-free token parser (`loader/proxy/activation.cpp:89`). Prefix near-misses and quoted
  text are covered, plus four child-role integration runs. The smoke check now requires the log PID
  to equal the launched game PID (`tools/smoke_test.ps1:117`). No hook/forwarding technique changed.
- Debug and Release: **4/4 CTest entries pass**, including **16 proxy cases** and **23 installer
  assertions**. The full Debug runner also runs **56 Python tests** (one pre-existing skip).
  Test discovery needed a repository-relative exclusion filter because the selected worktree has
  an ancestor named `out` (`tools/test.ps1:38`); filtering full absolute paths had hidden Python suites.
- Final Release PoC smoke evidence: `out/smoke/20261028T012849979Z/summary.json`:
  `success=true`, `restored=true`; all five launches reach `gm_construct`; console output matches
  after the documented normalization; all off switches produce no log; both tools match baseline.
  Map-load-plus-settle durations: baseline **6.59s**, enabled **6.56s**, command-off **6.53s**,
  environment-off **6.72s**, file-off **6.57s**. These are smoke durations, not benchmark results.
- The enabled log is from main PID **64992**, resolves **181/181** exports, and samples
  `engine.dll=0`, `shaderapidx9.dll=0`, `d3d9.dll=0` at the EXE entry point. Logged startup work:
  **0.2898ms**. Its command line contains the actual `-game garrysmod ... +map gm_construct`
  launch, not a Chromium helper role. Both final configurations still import **KERNEL32.dll only**.
- Final installed and uninstalled verifier reports each have **2,877 OK**, **0 missing**, **0 size
  mismatches**, **0 hash mismatches**, with the existing `autoexec.cfg` user-config difference.
  Evidence: `out/m1-poc-installed-verify.json`, `out/m1-poc-uninstalled-verify.json`. The PoC is left
  with no bootstrap DLL/PDB or loader state. Installed Release DLL SHA-256:
  `E9B1327A89853344DD967D4B6C5C8E48E52F49849C208EA7605B61EF278A3351`.

## 9. M3 deployment measurements (2026-10-27, Claude)

**Release `nlctl`, this machine, a package with a 323 MiB payload file** (the size of the runtime's
`d3d9.dll`, section 2) in a plain `.gma` in a scratch game folder:

| Command | Time | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `apply`, first | 1.75 s | extract, check size, CRC-32 and SHA-256, flush, place |
| `apply`, again (no-op) | 44 ms | 0 file-system changes, journal untouched |
| `status` | 13 ms | size and time of every recorded file |
| `status --verify` | 231 ms | SHA-256 of every file: about 1.4 GB/s with CNG on cached data |
| `uninstall` | 0.32 s | a full SHA-256 of each file before it is deleted |

The full 930 MB runtime should therefore deploy in about 5 s from a plain archive. From an
LZMA-wrapped one it takes longer, decoding at about 67 MB/s (section 5).

**Process costs.** In a Debug build a deployer command costs about 30 ms before it does any work:
the process start, plus one Toolhelp scan of all processes for the running-game check. Most of the
rest of a tiny deployment is durability: about 15 flushes and write-through renames per apply.
`test_deploy.cpp` therefore runs its thousands of in-process deployments on a file system without
flushes (`FastDisk`), and the test host skips the process scan.

**Change counts.** The fault test's scenarios, killed by `TerminateProcess` before each change; every
one ended in the old or the new state after recovery:

| Scenario | File-system changes |
|---|---|
| first deployment (runtime + root-files package) | 54 |
| upgrade (new runtime folder; root files replaced, added, removed) | 59 |
| rollback | 26 |
| uninstall | 35 |

**PoC acceptance.** The test package held a payload file, a mod file, a binary Lua module and a
create-only cfg file. The bootstrap install, `apply` and uninstall made 58 changes, the second apply
none. All 3,113 files and folders of `GarrysMod_PoC` were identical afterwards, sizes and times
included, and 2,877 depot files verified OK. Evidence: `out/poc-deploy/20261028-043358/` (the run
after the review fixes; the first run, `20261028-035222`, made 54 changes before payload files were
moved one by one).

**Windows behaviour the deployer relies on:**

- `MoveFileExW` without `MOVEFILE_COPY_ALLOWED` renames only within a volume, which is why staging
  lives under the game folder and links are refused there.
- `GetFileAttributesExW` reports a junction itself, not its target.
- A file opened with `FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT` is the link itself, so hashing refuses links.
- An exclusive handle (share mode 0) on `native-loader\lock` makes a second deployer fail with
  `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` until the first one's process ends.
- The running-game check snapshots processes with Toolhelp and opens each `gmod.exe` for its image
  path. A process that exits between the snapshot and `OpenProcess` fails with
  `ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER`, and only `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` means "cannot tell". Under parallel
  CTest, M1's proxy tests run short-lived synthetic `gmod.exe` processes. Treating every failed
  open as "running" made `nlctl_e2e_deploy` refuse now and then.
- Windows may keep an executable's image file locked for a moment after its process ends;
  `e2e_deploy.py` retries putting its placeholder `gmod.exe` back.

## 10. M4 activation research (2026-10-27, Claude)

Gathered while planning M4; scripts were one-offs under `out\tmp` (`pefile`, `ctypes`), read-only.

**Who reads the command line, and when** (PoC, build 26229091):

- `gmod.exe`, `launcher.dll`, `tier0.dll`, `vstdlib.dll`, `engine.dll`, `filesystem_stdio.dll`,
  `materialsystem.dll`, `shaderapidx9.dll` and `client.dll` each import both `GetCommandLineA` and
  `GetCommandLineW` from KERNEL32. `tier0.dll` exports `CommandLine`, `Plat_GetCommandLine` and
  `Plat_GetCommandLineA`; all the others except `gmod.exe` import `CommandLine` from it.
- None of `gmod.exe`, `launcher`, `tier0`, `vstdlib`, `engine`, `shaderapidx9`, `client` imports a
  C runtime DLL (`ucrtbase`, `api-ms-win-crt-*`, `vcruntime*`, `msvcp*`): they link it statically.
  `gmod.exe`'s static imports are only system DLLs and `WINMM` (ours); `launcher.dll` and the
  engine load later. So no engine module has read or cached the command line when our entry-point
  hook runs.
- kernelbase on this machine (Windows 10.0.26300.9711): `GetCommandLineW` is `48 8b 05 41 9f 2b 00 c3`
  and `GetCommandLineA` is `48 8b 05 41 08 2b 00 c3` (`mov rax,[rip+disp32]; ret`); KERNEL32's exports
  of the same names are `jmp [rip+x]` thunks to them. The pointer each returns sits at rva `0x3ae058`
  (W) and `0x3ae048` (A), as the `Buffer` of a `UNICODE_STRING` / `ANSI_STRING`: the 8 bytes before
  each slot hold `Length` = the string's length in bytes (202 and 101 for a 101-character command
  line) and `MaximumLength` = `Length` + one terminator.
- RTXLauncher passes `-dxlevel 90 +mat_disable_d3d9ex 1 -nod3d9ex` (section 4).

**How the runtime takes its config layers** (fork `dxvk-remix-gmod`):

- `resolveConfigPaths` (`src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_option_layer.cpp:617-627`): when
  `DXVK_RTX_CONFIG_FILE` (or `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE`) is set and not empty, the runtime reads only the
  paths it lists, split at commas; `.\rtx.conf` is read only when the variable is unset. So a loader
  that sets the variable must list the user's root `rtx.conf` itself.
- (Corrected in section 19: for `rtx.*` options the **first** listed path is the strongest, not the
  weakest.) `createLayersFromEnvVar` (`:629-647`) makes one layer per listed path, lowest priority first; the
  last `rtx.conf` layer becomes `s_rtxConfLayer` (`:704-712`), the one the Remix menu saves to. A
  layer whose file is missing or empty is registered but not merged (`isValid()` is "has options",
  `rtx_option_layer.h:141`).

**The runtime's files** (`H:\BACKUP_20260815\Modding\dxvk-remix-gmod`):

- `_output` is the complete runtime: 192 files, 1,117,358,408 bytes, built 2026-10-26 23:36, with
  `usd\` and the build by-products `d3d9.pdb`, `.exp`, `.lib`. Nothing the classic install keeps in
  `GarrysMod_RTX_c\bin\win64` for the runtime is missing from it.
- `_CompRelease_x64\src\d3d9\d3d9.dll` (338,675,200 bytes, 2026-10-27 11:32) is the newest build and
  the same file as `built-A8E39D93-lockfree-options\d3d9.dll`. The `built-*` and `deployed-*` folders
  hold only `d3d9.dll` and `d3d9.pdb` (140,800,000 bytes for A8E39D93).
- `d3d9.dll`'s only delay-load import is `amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll`, loaded by bare name; its static
  imports include the UCRT API sets (`api-ms-win-crt-*`) besides the VC++ runtime of section 2.
- `msvcp140.dll`, `vcruntime140.dll`, `vcruntime140_1.dll` and `vulkan-1.dll` are only in System32 on
  this machine, not in the PoC's or `GarrysMod_RTX_c`'s `bin\win64`; the classic install keeps
  `amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll` in `bin\win64`.
- `GarrysMod_RTX_c\bin\win64` holds 77 files (3.63 GB) beyond vanilla: the runtime mixed with
  backups, PDBs, Jolt, the MMD hotloader, VR files, `NvRemixBridge`, `dxsupport.cfg` and a
  `debug.log`. A runtime package therefore takes an explicit file set (`_output`), not that folder.
- `GarrysMod_RTX_c` has the user's `rtx.conf` (161,131 bytes) and `dxvk.conf` (2,610 bytes) in its
  root, the layers the classic install runs with.

## 11. M4 implementation and acceptance findings (2026-10-28, Codex)

- Section 10's cached-string layout is now checked before any write, including the PEB descriptor.
  Synthetic descriptor tests cover mismatched Length/MaximumLength/pointer, USHORT overflow and a
  failure after a partial write. A separate process swaps the real kernelbase W/A and PEB records,
  checks updated lengths and restores their exact bytes (`loader/core/src/cmdline.cpp:96`,
  `loader/tests/cmdline_host.cpp`). The user approved loader version 0.1.0 to match the packager's
  existing `requires_loader >=0.1.0` contract.
- Debug and Release pass **15/15 CTest entries**. Core cases total **120** (117 normal plus three
  exhaustive fault groups); proxy cases remain **16**, installer assertions **23**. Python: **66**
  tests, one pre-existing skip. The PE CTest confirms the final bootstrap imports only KERNEL32.
  Steam registry lookup now dynamically resolves RegGetValueW from System32 advapi32
  (`loader/core/src/discovery.cpp:40`).
- The packaged fake runtime proves bare-name d3d9 reuse, static and delay dependency paths, user
  layers/arguments, full failure rollback, explicit fallback options, all off switches, contention,
  source disappearance/removal and version/hold behavior. **17 scenario groups** pass. Isolated
  Release evidence: `out/m4-synthetic/release-62268/summary.json`; ten unchanged-deployment samples
  have **25.8064 ms median**, **19.8476–27.9013 ms** range, zero deployment operations. Timing ends
  before final report I/O. Raising a native exception in the fake DLL initializer produced Windows
  error **1114** and verified vanilla continuation with restored settings.
- The named B folder was absent. Section 10's alternate `_CompRelease_x64/src/d3d9/d3d9.dll` was
  present with the documented size/time and the **A8E39D93** prefix. Full hashes used:
  - A: `E5C65136EA8BC7A7485776C18F975FE8068F74B5743DC8EA536AAFF8D6065BCA`;
  - B: `A8E39D938D96193DF27D245A7F6E72F1C44B75FB2D066A67BDC2CD974EDEA267`.
  The acceptance script pins the full B hash before accepting this alternate copy. No fork file
  was changed. Config snapshots were hash-checked and reused for both packages.
- Real evidence is under `out/poc-activation/20261028T075336206Z/`. Original A contains **191 files,
  977,303,948 bytes** without PDBs; B has **191 files, 977,403,788 bytes**. These measured sizes
  supersede the earlier rough full-runtime estimate for this recipe.
- The user approved each actual launch and explicitly requested **-multirun**, keeping the RTX_c
  install open. Vanilla PoC PID **6876** reached gm_construct with System32 d3d9 and **mat_dxlevel 95**.
  The initial A PID **70300** deployed generation 1 in **4808.77 ms**, activated in **36.5178 ms**,
  and completed startup in **4846.04 ms**. The engine printed **mat_dxlevel 90**, proving it saw
  the injected arguments. Remix logged an RTX 5090 device, successful Reflex initialization,
  ray-tracing feature support and swapchain creation, then the engine exited before map completion.
- The copied classic DXVK config has **d3d9.shaderModel = 0** (snapshot line 10). The fork rejects
  shader bytecode above that option (`src/d3d9/d3d9_shader.cpp:115`), explaining the logged
  “GetShaderModule: Out of range of supported shader model” errors. Its default is **3**
  (`src/d3d9/d3d9_options.cpp:69`). Windows event 1000 recorded a PoC engine.dll fault with
  exception **0xc0000409**; the exact engine termination cause was not independently debugged.
- After §9 consultation, the user approved a **PoC-only shaderModel=3 layer** and one A retry.
  It kept both reference configs unchanged and added one 132-byte layer. PID **31480** reached
  gm_construct at **mat_dxlevel 90**. Deployment: **4920.9048 ms**; activation: **39.4931 ms**.
  All **34** loaded runtime DLLs in `03-RunA/runtime-modules.json` came from the versioned package,
  including d3d9, amd_fidelityfx_vk, NvLowLatencyVk and the DLSS family.
- The user reported **not path-traced/rendering incorrectly**, then stopped further PoC testing.
  Real RTX-off output, **dxlevel persistence**, B activation and rollback therefore remain open.
  Startup activation success is not evidence of successful later rendering.
- Cleanup removed 383 package files and the bootstrap/control/status state. `verify.json` reports
  **2,877 OK**, **0 missing**, **0 size mismatches**, **0 hash mismatches**, with the existing
  autoexec.cfg user-config difference. `created-or-changed.txt` records preserved Remix/Sentry logs,
  capture directories, engine crash artifacts, metrics and game-written config/cache/console changes.
  No game/Remix data was deleted for cleanup. The other RTX_c instance remained running.

## 11. Session side effects and automation (2026-10-28, Claude)

**Settings GMod keeps between sessions.**

- GMod's video settings are in `HKCU\Software\Valve\Source\garrysmod\Settings` (`ScreenWidth`,
  `ScreenWindowed`, `mat_*`, `DXLevel_V1`, ...). The key has the mod folder's name, so the field
  install, the PoC and `GarrysMod_RTX_c` all share it.
- `DXLevel_V1` does not decide the level a session runs at. With 90 stored (since 2026-10-27 02:02),
  vanilla PoC sessions ran at `mat_dxlevel 95` (Codex's baseline, and run 1 below) and wrote 95 back
  at start-up; a session started with `-dxlevel 90` ran at 90.
- `-dxlevel 90` does not carry over: three PoC sessions, vanilla, `-dxlevel 90 -nod3d9ex
  +mat_disable_d3d9ex 1`, vanilla again, ran at 95, 90 and 95, and neither the registry key nor
  `config.cfg` changed (evidence `out\m4-review\persistence-20261028T040607`; the key was restored
  from the backup taken first).
- Archived console variables persist in the install's own `garrysmod\cfg\config.cfg`, which the game
  writes when it quits normally. The PoC's already held `mat_disable_d3d9ex "1"` before M4; a vanilla
  session then reports `"mat_disable_d3d9ex" = "1" ( def. "0" )` and "mat_disable_d3d9ex changes will
  not take effect until application restart": the variable is read when the device is created,
  before `config.cfg` or `+` commands run. So `+mat_disable_d3d9ex 1` on the command line only changes
  the next session (through `config.cfg`), while `-nod3d9ex`, which `shaderapidx9.dll` reads (both
  strings are in it), acts on the current one.

**Ending a session without a person.**

- `game.ConsoleCommand("quit\n")` from server Lua is refused: `game.ConsoleCommand blocked! (quit)`.
- The menu state loads a fixed list of files (`lua/menu/menu.lua`); `RunGameUICommand("QuitNoConfirm")`
  exists only there, so it cannot be reached without changing depot files.
- `WM_CLOSE` to the main window (`CloseMainWindow`) does not end the game (15 s; Codex saw the same).
- Source's TCP remote console does: with `-usercon -ip 127.0.0.1 -port <p> +rcon_password <x>` and a
  listen server (`+maxplayers 2`), an RCON `quit` ends the session normally (exit code 0). In a
  single-player session the remote console does not listen (connection refused).
  [`tools/poc_session.py`](../tools/poc_session.py.md) uses this.

**Shader DLLs.** A vanilla session at `mat_dxlevel 95` loads `stdshader_dx6.dll` too, by full path:
the module list shows `h:\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\garrysmod_poc\bin\win64\stdshader_dx6.dll`,
lower-cased by the engine's file system.

**Windows loader.** At an `LdrRegisterDllNotification` "loaded" callback, the new module's imports
are already bound (`wininet.dll`: 355 of 355 import address table entries resolved, Windows
10.0.26300). An import hook installed then is in place before the module's own code runs.

## 12. What the classic RTX install adds (M5 research, 2026-10-28, Claude with a research agent)

Compared with the PoC (vanilla build 26229091). "Verified" as in the header; offsets are PoC file
offsets or RVAs as stated.

**`GarrysMod_RTX_c` runs an older GMod build.** Of its engine binaries only `tier0.dll` matches a
cached depot manifest; its VPKs (`garrysmod_000-002`, `fallbacks_*`, `sourceengine\content_hl2_dir`)
differ from the PoC's too. Its runtime is B (`d3d9.dll` SHA-256 `a8e39d938d96193d...`).

**On-disk engine patches.** RTXLauncher applies `patches64` from `sambow23/SourceRTXTweaks`
(`applypatch.py`, fetched at install time; no local copy). Each pattern must match exactly once;
RTX_c holds each in patched form. All seven match exactly once in the PoC's build:

| DLL | Pattern (offset) | Replacement | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| engine | `ff90????????85c0742b` (0) | `b80200000090` | `Mod_LoadLighting`: HDR type 2 |
| engine | `ff90????????85c00f84fa000000` (0) | `b80200000090` | `Mod_LoadWorldlights`: HDR |
| shaderapidx9 | `4833cce8????03004881c448` (0) | `85c0750466b80400` | zero-sized buffer returns 4 |
| shaderapidx9 | `4883ec084c` (0) | `31c0c3` | shader constants function returns 0 |
| shaderapidx9 | `4885db75??498b4500` (3) | `eb` | skip the invalid-vertex-format `Error()` |
| materialsystem | `f77c24683bc10f4fc1488b8c24300100004833cce8????04004881c448010000` (0) | `448b4424684585c0740341f7f839c80f4fc14881c448010000c3` | zero-sized buffer guard |
| datacache | `647838302e767478` (0) | `647839302e767478` | `dx80.vtx` to `dx90.vtx` |

`MaterialSystemFallbackPatch` does not apply to either build (a 2-byte `66 90` where it needs a
15-byte site) and was never applied to RTX_c. The fixes' module applies 8 other, in-memory
engine/client culling patches itself (`source/culling_patches.cpp:81-347`, from `module.cpp:427`);
`source/culling_fixes.cpp` (with "these don't apply properly") is dead code: `CullingHooks` is never
initialised (corrects section 3).

**How `stdshader_dx6.dll` is loaded.** `materialsystem.dll`'s `LoadAllShaderDLLs` (rva `0x4b010`)
asks for `stdshader_dbg.dll`, then `stdshader_dx6.dll` up to the dx level, through
`IFileSystem::LoadModule` (vtable +0xe8). `filesystem_stdio.dll` resolves the name against the
`EXECUTABLE_PATH` search path (`bin\win64`, added first by `launcher.dll`) and calls
`LoadLibraryExA(<full path>, NULL, LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH)` from its `Sys_LoadModule` (rva
`0x5ebe0`; the call at `0x5eb02`). Preloading a copy elsewhere therefore does not help; an import hook
on `filesystem_stdio.dll`'s `LoadLibraryExA` does. `LoadLibraryExA` is also imported by materialsystem,
engine and launcher, `LoadLibraryA` by tier0, engine and shaderapidx9, none delay-loaded.

**The fixes' shader DLL.** A binary committed in the fixes at `garrysmod/bin/win64/stdshader_dx6.dll`
(byte-identical to RTX_c's, 437,248 bytes; sources removed in 4b9da1e, readme points to
`sambow23/obsolete-source-engine`): fixed-function ports of spritecard, eyes/eye_refract, wireframe
and water. It finds `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary_win64.dll!RTX_SetEyeTexGenState` by that module name at run
time. With RTX_c's `dxvk.conf` (`d3d9.shaderModel = 0`, line 10) RTX_c's own Remix log also shows
"Out of range of supported shader model" (28 times), so that message is normal there.

**The fixes' other pieces.** `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary_win64.dll` (1,441,792 bytes in RTX_c, built
2026-10-27), `gmcl_rtxwater_win64.dll`, `gmcl_rtxdebug_win64.dll` (all import only tier0, ole32,
KERNEL32). Lua: `addons/remixbinary/lua/autorun/cl_rtx.lua` (`require("RTXFixesBinary")` at :10,
multiplayer guard at :4), rtx_water (`cl_native.lua:37-42`), niknaks and others. Remix mods from the
fixes: `base_mod` (37 MB), `rtx_water` (11 MB), `gm_poolrooms_rtx` (150 MB), `~gmod_topbr` (87 files
in the repo; ToPBR writes generated DDS files there at run time). `autoexec.cfg` is the fixes' file:
`sv_cheats 1`, `mat_disable_d3d9ex 1`, `r_3dsky 0`, water reflection/refraction 0, `r_shadows 0`,
`mat_softwareskin 1`, specular/bump/normal/parallax 0, `r_frustumcullworld 0`, `r_occlusion 0`,
`r_novis 1`, plus the user's own settings. The fixes also overwrite five Steam files (menu
`problems.lua`, sandbox `gmod_camera.lua`, three images), which this project's rule 2 forbids.
Built with premake 5 and garrysmod_common, VS 2022; no release zip locally.

**The user's test save and measure.** Reference save
`GarrysMod_RTX_c\garrysmod\saves\gm_csgosafehouse 2026-10-25 04-08-30.gms`. Harness
`C:\Users\matt-peng\.rpai\work\_probe\session_run.py` (fixed camera `REF_CAMERA`, captures with the
`jpeg` command, HUD and view model hidden). Measure `look\compare.py`: crop both images to a multiple
of 32, take the mean RGB of every 32x32 block, report the mean absolute difference over all blocks and
channels (0-255); about 1 between repeated captures, 1.5-3.6 "close", 16-26 "broken". The save needs
the Workshop map 944959992 (a legacy `.bin`, 162 MB, in the shared Workshop folder), the CS:GO mount,
the user's `SafeHouse` Remix mod, and the MMD Hot Loader character with its `ai_pbr` mod. The classic
install's launch line (`_debug_tools\launch_gmod_keeplogs.bat:12`) is `-console -condebug -dxlevel 90
+mat_disable_d3d9ex 1 -nod3d9ex -windowed -noborder -w 3840 -h 2160 -tickrate 128 -multirun -insecure
+r_forcehwlight 1`; RTXLauncher adds `-noworkshop` only when its `LoadWorkshopAddons` is false (the
user's is true; corrects section 4).

## 13. M5 on the PoC (2026-10-28, Claude)

**Add-on mounting.** GMod x64 mounts an add-on **folder** in `garrysmod/addons` ("Adding Filesystem
Addon 'addons/nl_probe_folder'", its client autorun ran) but not a loose `.gma` placed there, plain
Lua or not (no message, the Lua did not run): `out/poc-sessions/m5-mount-probe`. Local packages
therefore deploy their Lua as add-on folders ([ADR 0011](decisions/0011-lua-addon-folders.md)).

**`SetDllDirectoryW` broke the RTX fixes.** garrysmod_common's `ModuleLoader.cpp` finds GMod's
modules with `GetModuleHandleExA(0, "bin/win64/lua_shared.dll", ...)`, a path relative to the working
directory. With M4's `SetDllDirectoryW(<runtime folder>)`, which also drops the working directory from
the DLL search, that lookup failed: the fixes' module printed "Failed to get ILuaConVars interface" and
"Failed to create or find convar" for its 15 variables, and the game ended with `0xC0000409` right
after the map loaded. With the runtime folder first on `PATH` instead, the module reports "Got
ILuaConVars interface" and every variable ready, and the session quits normally
([ADR 0010](decisions/0010-rtx-session-extras.md) point 4).

**The loader's RTX session on the PoC** (runtime B with the reference install's `rtx.conf` and
`dxvk.conf` as layers, the fixes package built from the fixes repo with `GarrysMod_RTX_c`'s modules,
the reference install's user content copied by [`poc_parity.py`](../tools/poc_parity.py.md)):

- First start deployed both packages (445 changes, 1.43 GB) in 7.3 s, activation 31 ms; a later start
  changed nothing, deployment 54 ms, start-up 80 ms in all.
- All 7 patch sets applied (engine 2, materialsystem 1, datacache 1, shaderapidx9 3), 15 game modules
  hooked, `filesystem_stdio`'s load of `bin\win64\stdshader_dx6.dll` redirected to the package's copy,
  33 session variables run through `nativeloader_session.cfg`.
- gm_construct at the spawn camera (eye 815.2, 288.0, -79.1, yaw 180, pinned in both installs, HUD
  hidden): `GarrysMod_RTX_c` and the PoC differ by **block_diff 0.90** (the user's measure: about 1
  between repeated captures of one install); mean RGB 119.5/113.2/101.0 in both. Evidence
  `out/m5/acceptance/ref-construct-pinned-2` and `poc-construct-pinned`.

**Session variables do not leak in practice.** After RTX sessions that quit normally, none of the
33 session variables appears in the PoC's `config.cfg` (they are not archived in this GMod build), so
the restore record stays empty (`recorded: 0`); the restore is a safety net for variables a package
adds that are.

**Things in the reference install to know about.** Launched with `-noworkshop`, one of its local
add-ons opens a "Zippy's Library missing" dialog that dims the frame (closed by `poc_session.py
--hide-hud`). Its `rtx-remix\mods` holds two **symbolic links**, `codex_new` and `codex_test`, whose
targets lead back up the tree: a copy that follows links never ends (robocopy wrote about 390 GB before
it was stopped). `poc_parity.py` skips linked mods and passes `/XJ`. Five of its 29 add-on folders
are symbolic links or junctions to the user's working copies under `H:\BACKUP_20260815\Modding\ipg\`
(`!advanced_material_editor`, `!gmod_bullet_break_simulator`, `advanced_bodygroup_tool`,
`eeer_body_impact_sounds`, `enhanced_entity_expression_response`; 8.4 GB with their `.git`).

**Loading the user's test save without anyone at the keyboard.**

- The save's map, `gm_csgosafehouse`, exists only as Workshop item 944959992 (a legacy LZMA `.bin`).
  With `-noworkshop`, `gm_load "saves/<name>.gms"` does nothing and prints nothing. With bad
  arguments it prints `usage: gm_load <path>`, so the command itself exists.
- With the Workshop on, the reference install printed nothing for 15 minutes after the material
  system started. It was still busy (about 2 cores, 9 GB working set) when the session driver gave
  up. The user has 753 Workshop archives installed.
- `host_workshop_map` is unknown on a single-player client.
- What works: client Lua `steamworks.DownloadUGC("944959992", cb)` hands back
  `cache/workshop/944959992.gma` (the legacy item decompressed) at once, and `game.MountGMA` on it
  returns true with one file. `gm_load` then changes level to the save's map.
  `poc_session.py --mount-workshop` does this.
- On that level change both installs log "Couldn't write cache/map_pack.bsp to mount embedded
  content!" (GMod's handling of a map inside a mounted `.gma`). The PoC's extracted copy of the map
  was removed so both load it the same way.
- Text sent through `WM_COPYDATA` while the RTX fixes reload models after a map change can be
  accepted by the window and then lost. The camera Lua sent 3 s after `Clientside Lua startup!` never
  ran, while a `quit` sent later did.

**The safehouse comparison, and what the remaining difference is not.** Reference
`ref-safehouse-mounted` against PoC captures with growing parity, all at the user's camera and
loading the save through the mounted Workshop map:

| PoC capture | block_diff |
|---|---|
| + the reference's 16 plain add-ons and the MMD Hot Loader's and RTX bridges' native files | 3.23 |
| + the Advanced Material Editor's data (`garrysmod/data/advmat`: 29 rules, 32 RTX profiles) | 3.23 |
| + the 5 add-ons linked to working copies, and the 2 linked Remix mods (`codex_new`, `codex_test`) | 3.18 |
| + the reference's own `~gmod_topbr` mod instead of the package's | 3.24 |

Two reference frames 4 s apart differ by 0.83. These are byte-identical in both installs: `d3d9.dll`
(a8e39d93), `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary_win64.dll` (485667b7), `stdshader_dx6.dll` (4bf218db),
`rtx.conf`, `dxvk.conf`, `user.conf`, `config.cfg`, `base_mod`, `gm_poolrooms_rtx` and `rtx_water`.
Geometry, lighting and shadows match. The difference sits in 41-46 of 880 blocks above 8, on the
woven chair backs, which are darker in the PoC. What could not be made equal is the game build: the
reference runs GMod 2026.09.15 (10174) with older `engine.dll` and VPKs, the PoC the current
2026.10.26 (10215). Depot files are never written, so that difference stays.

**Without RTX, a deployed package's Lua add-ons still run** (PoC, `remix.enabled: false`, before
ADR 0013).

- GMod mounted the fixes' nine add-on folders ("Adding Filesystem Addon 'addons/remixbinary'").
- Their server Lua initialised ("[RTX Flashlight] Default flashlight override: ENABLED").
- `cl_rtx.lua` `require`s the binary module whenever it is installed. The module noticed Remix was
  missing ("remix::loadRemixDllAndInitialize() failed"), applied none of its own runtime patches
  ("[MemoryPatcher] Disabled 0 patches") and shut down; RTX Water stayed off.
- The module's own PatchManager is a second patcher besides the loader's patch sets. In RTX sessions
  it resolves the same seven culling patches by its own locators and applies them, then restores them
  at map exit.
- `filesystem_stdio.dll` imports `FindFirstFileA`, `FindNextFileA`, `FindFirstFileExW` and
  `FindNextFileW` from KERNEL32, which is where ADR 0013 hides the add-ons. `engine.dll` and
  `tier0.dll` import only the `ExW`/`W` pair.

**The fixes write into their own deployed files.** The ToPBR converter rewrote
`rtx-remix/mods/~gmod_topbr/topbr_generation.txt` in the first PoC session. The deployer then reports
it ("changed after the loader placed it; left as it is"), and an uninstall leaves it behind. A
reinstall then refused the whole fixes package: "topbr_generation.txt already exists and was not
placed by the loader". `package_fixes.py` now deploys that mod create-only.

## 14. Workshop packing and updates (M6, 2026-10-28, Claude)

- `gmad.exe create` (the PoC's `bin\win64\gmad.exe`) on a folder holding `lua/autorun/a.lua`,
  `native/manifest.json` and `native/payload/test.dll`: "native/manifest.json [Not allowed by
  whitelist]", "native/payload/test.dll [Not allowed by whitelist]", "File list verification failed",
  no `.gma` written. The same folder with only the Lua file packs (181 bytes). Evidence
  `out/m6/gmad-probe`.
- **That whitelist is a packing limit, not a Workshop rule** (the user's correction, checked
  2026-10-28).
  - The `.dll`/`.exe`/`.htm`/`.html`/`.css`/`.js` list on the wiki's
    [Workshop Addon Creation](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Workshop_Addon_Creation) page says what
    `gmad.exe` will pack.
  - The [Steam Workshop rules](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Steam_Workshop_Rules) have no rule
    about file types. They ban exploits and backdoors, paid-game content, reuploads, wrong tags, and
    empty, test or placeholder items. Their "good ideas" list (not bans, but it can get an item flagged
    as incompatible) includes "do not upload broken addons", with a size limit of about 4 GB.
- **The real package through the Workshop** (ADR 0016, 2026-10-28).
  - `gmpublish update` uploaded the combined `gmod-rtx-remix` archive, 1,426,861,733 bytes (shown as
    "1.3 GB"), to item 3829070317. The archive was stored plain, not compressed.
  - Building it with `publish_workshop.py` takes seconds when the inputs are in the file cache.
  - GMod's `DownloadUGC` fetched it back byte-identical, under the uploaded file name.
  - `appworkshop_4000.acf` then listed it with the new `timeupdated` (1793223164), and the loader
    reported that time in `status.json`.
- Not tried at first: `gmpublish` (it uploads, with no dry run; outward-facing). Tried on 2026-10-28
  with the user's approval ([ADR 0015](decisions/0015-workshop-route-for-native-packages.md),
  [M6 report](handover/M6-report.md)):
  - **Upload.** `bin\win64\gmpublish.exe create -addon <gma> -icon <512x512 baseline JPEG>`, run
    from a game root that holds `steam_appid.txt`, uploaded a `gmapack` archive with
    `native/manifest.json` and a DLL. It did not check the contents. It printed "Success! Your new
    item ID is 3829070317" and "currently marked as hidden". `update -id <id> -addon <gma> -changes
    <text>` replaced the file.
  - **Download.** GMod's `steamworks.DownloadUGC(id, cb)` fetched the hidden item for its owner,
    without a subscription.
    - It went to `steamapps\workshop\content\4000\<id>\<uploaded file name>`, as a plain `.gma` (not
      LZMA-wrapped), byte-identical. An update replaced the file under the new upload's name.
    - `cb` got the path `content/4000/<id>/<name>.gma`.
    - `appworkshop_4000.acf` listed the item under `WorkshopItemsInstalled` (size, `timeupdated`,
      manifest) and under `WorkshopItemDetails`.
  - **GMod's own mount.** `game.MountGMA` refuses an archive that holds a file outside GMod's
    whitelist, printing "Couldn't mount file [<path>]" and returning false. A Lua-only `gmapack`
    archive mounts. A Workshop item that carries native files is therefore never mounted by GMod,
    and its Lua must come from elsewhere.
- The deployer handles LZMA-wrapped legacy Workshop items end to end, an update included
  (`loader/cli/tests/e2e_deploy.py`, M3).
- `steamworks.FileInfo(id, callback)` gives the item's Workshop `updated` time; the companion compares
  it with the `time_updated` that `appworkshop_4000.acf` had at start-up (now in `status.json`
  `packages`) and asks for a restart when it is newer (`tools/tests/test_companion.py`).


## 15. The field install with the loader (M7, 2026-10-28, Claude)

Measured in the user's Steam-managed install: gm_construct, the user's 44 local add-ons, no Workshop,
camera pinned. Evidence in `out/m7` ([M7 report](handover/M7-report.md)).

- **What the field install holds besides Steam's files.**
  - In `bin/win64`: a DXVK `d3d9.dll` (4 MB) for non-RTX play, a `vulkan-1.dll` (903 KB, five hard
    links), the MMD Hot Loader runtime, Jolt's three `vphysics_jolt_*.dll` with PDBs and its zip, and
    VR and Hammer++ files.
  - In `garrysmod/lua/bin`: the MMD Hot Loader's modules and VRMod's.
  - In the root: logs, `steam_appid.txt`, and GModPatchTool's folder and zip.
  - In `garrysmod/data`: 61 GB in 39,613 files.
  - No `rtx-remix`, `user.conf` or `rtx.conf`.
  - 76 non-depot files sit directly in the folders sessions write to, 255 MB; `field_snapshot.py`
    copies them in 3.4 s.
- **Without the loader** the game loads the DXVK `d3d9.dll` and `bin/win64/vulkan-1.dll`, the
  MMD Hot Loader's three modules, and the stock `vphysics.dll`. Jolt is not loaded. `mat_dxlevel` is 95.
- **With the loader and RTX on** it loads the runtime package's `d3d9.dll`, System32's
  `vulkan-1.dll` (the preload wins over `bin/win64`), the package's `stdshader_dx6.dll` and the
  fixes' module, the MMD Hot Loader as before, and `mat_dxlevel` 90. First deployment: 445 changes;
  map after 19 s.
  - Remix shows its first-run welcome panel, because the install has no `user.conf`.
  - The default Remix settings give a bluer frame than the PoC with the reference's `user.conf`
    (mean RGB 73/94/105 against 120/113/101).
- **With the loader and RTX off** the module set equals the baseline's plus the bootstrap, the 44 add-ons
  mount (the fixes' 9 hidden), and the frame matches the baseline's at block_diff 0.015.
- **What a session rewrites in the user's data**, all with unchanged sizes:
  - the MMD Hot Loader's `approved.json` and `workshop/state.json`;
  - `bbs/filters.json`;
  - `settings/mapkeys.res`;
  - in RTX sessions, the fixes' `pseudoweapontexture*.png`.

  New in RTX sessions: the fixes' `rtx_agent`, `rtx_water` and `pseudoplayertexture*.png` in
  `garrysmod/data`, and `rtx-remix/` (Remix's logs).

## 16. R1 review facts (2026-10-28, Claude, triaging Codex's review)

- **Steam's depot files inside the package areas.** Measured read-only from the field install's
  depot manifests (`out/r1-triage/depot_areas.py` in the R1 worktree, 3,063 depot file entries):
  - `garrysmod/cfg/` holds 18: `360controller-linux.cfg`, `360controller.cfg`, `autoexec.cfg`,
    `config_default.cfg`, `game.cfg`, `listenserver.cfg`, `mapcycle.txt`, `mount.cfg`, `network.cfg`,
    `server.cfg`, `settings_default.scr`, `skill.cfg`, `skill1.cfg`, `skill2.cfg`, `skill3.cfg`,
    `skill_manifest.cfg`, `undo360controller.cfg`, `valve.rc`. So `garrysmod/cfg` stopped being a
    package area ([ADR 0014](decisions/0014-r1-hardening.md)).
  - `garrysmod/lua/bin/`, `garrysmod/addons/`, `garrysmod/data/` and `rtx-remix/` hold none.
- **Import tables without names.** A PE import descriptor may have `OriginalFirstThunk` 0. Windows
  then resolves the imports from `FirstThunk` and overwrites it with addresses, so the names are
  gone once the module is mapped. Codex's repro (R1-006) zeroed it in a copy of the synthetic
  `filesystem_stdio.dll`: the DLL loads, and name-based hooks find nothing.
  - The hooks now match such slots by the bound address.
  - `GetProcAddress` on kernel32 follows its forwarders, so `GetProcAddress(kernel32, ...)` and
    `GetProcAddress(kernelbase, ...)` give the addresses the loader binds.
- **Windows PowerShell 5.1 started from PowerShell 7.** It inherits `PSModulePath` with PowerShell 7's
  module folders first. It then fails to autoload `Get-FileHash` (`Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility`), and
  `install-loader.ps1` stops (R1-029, seen in Codex's second `tools\test.ps1` run). A child started
  without `PSModulePath` builds its own default path and works.
  - The failure reproduces without PowerShell 7 installed: put a Core-only
    `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility` module first in `PSModulePath`. Its manifest must declare every
    Utility cmdlet, as PowerShell 7's does; one declaring only `Get-FileHash` does not reproduce it.
    The field-snapshot and session-driver tests do this.
- **`reg import` and line breaks.** `reg export` writes a `REG_SZ` value holding a line break as
  `\r\r\n`, and `reg import` cannot restore it. `field_snapshot.py` reads exports strictly and refuses
  to prune after a failed import (R1-011).

## 17. GitHub's Windows runner (CI, 2026-10-28, Claude)

- **The runner decodes text as cp1252; this machine decodes UTF-8.**
  - The runner: GitHub's `windows-2022` image (20261022.344.1, runner 2.338.0, CPython 3.12.10 from
    `setup-python`). Its ANSI code page is 1252, so Python decodes a text-mode pipe without an
    `encoding` as cp1252.
  - This machine's ANSI code page is 65001 (Windows' UTF-8 option). `locale.getpreferredencoding(False)`
    gives `cp65001` even with `PYTHONUTF8=0`, so no local run sees the difference.
- **`nlctl` and the C++ test hosts write UTF-8 whatever the code page.** They `fwrite` UTF-8 JSON and
  read the environment with `GetEnvironmentVariableW` (`loader/core/src/activate.cpp`).
- **The first CI run (40779899329) failed `nl_activation_integration`** with "CLI and startup layer
  plans differ".
  - The layer list holds `用户.conf`, which cp1252 turns into `ç”¨æˆ·.conf`.
  - Start-up's `status.json` had the name right.
  - Tests now pass `encoding='utf-8'` when they read `nlctl` or a host, and open files with an explicit
    encoding.
  - A Python child (`package_runtime.py`) writes in the same locale encoding its parent reads, so
    those calls stay as they are.
- **Reproduced here** with a throwaway wrapper (not committed). It makes text-mode `subprocess` pipes,
  and files opened without an encoding, use cp1252: it patches `subprocess.Popen.__init__`, `io.open`
  and `io.text_encoding`, then runs the test with `runpy.run_path`.
  - The old test failed at the same line; the fixed one passed all 17 cases.
  - CTest starts the test with `python -I`, so a `sitecustomize` on `PYTHONPATH` would not load.
- **The runner has no Vulkan loader** (`System32\vulkan-1.dll`). The activation test skips its
  "optional Vulkan preload uses System32" case there.
- **Node 24 actions.**
  - GitHub runs Node 20 actions on Node 24 and warns about each one.
  - The first majors that target Node 24: `checkout` v5, `setup-python` v6, `upload-artifact` v6 and
    `download-artifact` v7. Their release notes change nothing else this workflow uses, and they
    need runner 2.327.1 or later.
  - Later majors existed on 2026-10-28: checkout v7, setup-python v7, upload-artifact v7, and
    download-artifact v8, which makes a digest mismatch an error.
- **Timings of the first run.** `tools\test.ps1 -Config Release` took 4 min 14 s: CTest 21 s for 16
  tests, the Python suites about 40 s.

## 18. The first field test of the release bundle (2026-10-28, Claude)

The setup: the field install with the CI-built loader 0.2.0 and the subscribed item 3829070317. The
player's Steam launch options were `-multirun -insecure -tickrate 120`. Evidence: the loader's own
logs and `status.json`, and Remix's log. The user's console log was not read.

- **Every start crashed to the desktop.** There were three starts, 22:53-22:55 UTC. The last one
  crashed 9 s in.
  - The loader did its part. It deployed the item (442 changes, 7.5 s on the first start), activated
    it, applied 7 of 7 patch sets and the shader override, and hooked 15 modules.
  - Remix's log (`rtx-remix/logs/remix-dxvk.log`) ends with these lines:
    - a 640x480 device with `Windowed: false`;
    - `Setting display mode: 640x480@0`;
    - `FSR FG: onDestroy called`;
    - `[D3D9WindowProc] Swapchain handle is invalid, some of its values may not be correct.`
  - Remix's crash handler (Sentry) wrote `rtx-remix/logs/.sentry-native/last_crash` 1 ms later.
    Windows logged no Application Error.
- **Why 640x480 fullscreen.** On the PoC, `DXLevel_V1` 95 was stored (what non-RTX sessions write),
  and the video key (section 11) held 960x540, windowed, borderless. A start with `-dxlevel 90` ignored
  that size and window mode, and made a 640x480 exclusive-fullscreen device.
- **Reproduced on the PoC** with the field's launch options and `DXLevel_V1` 95 (a throwaway script in
  the worktree's `out/fullscreen`):
  - Without window options: the same log lines, then exit `0xC0000005` after 13.6 s.
  - With `-windowed -noborder -w 3840 -h 2160` added by hand: a windowed 3840x2160 device, still running
    after 45 s, no crash record.
  - With loader 0.2.1 and no window options: the loader added those options itself, with the same
    result ([ADR 0018](decisions/0018-rtx-sessions-in-a-borderless-window.md)).
  - Windowed sessions log one "Swapchain handle is invalid" warning too, and do not crash.
- **The window options GMod x64 reads**, from strings in the PoC's `engine.dll` and `launcher.dll`:
  `-windowed -window -sw -startwindowed -full -fullscreen -noborder -w -width -h -height`.
- **`gmod.exe` is per-monitor DPI aware.** Its manifest has `<dpiAware>true/PM</dpiAware>`.
- **This machine's display:** the RTX 5090 drives the primary display at 3840x2160 and 240 Hz. The
  CPU's AMD graphics are present too.
- **GMod extracts Workshop items separately for each install.**
  - Legacy items are extracted to `garrysmod/cache/workshop/<id>.gma`, beside `<n>.cache` files.
  - The PoC had never mounted the user's subscriptions, because automated sessions pass `-noworkshop`.
    Three starts with the field's options extracted 163 files (4.4 GB). Each start continued with new
    items. The one item a stopped session had been writing was extracted again.
  - Item 3829070317 is never extracted: it is a plain `.gma`.
  - The field install's cache was last written on 2026-10-24.

## 19. Field parity with the classic install (R2, 2026-10-29, Claude with four research agents)

The measure: the pool rooms (`gm_poolrooms`, Workshop 2849511871, mounted from client Lua by
`poc_session.py --mount-workshop ... --change-map gm_poolrooms`) at a pinned camera. The camera is at
the map's spawn point `1336 -456 -82` (eye z -18), pitch 5, yaw 342.5, with the HUD hidden. The block
measure is that of section 12. Evidence is in the worktree's `out/round2`.

**The runtime fork's config layers** (`dxvk-remix-gmod`, branch `gmod-1.6.1`; corrects sections 2 and 10):

- **For `rtx.*` options, the first entry of a `DXVK_RTX_CONFIG_FILE` or `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE` list is the
  strongest.**
  - Earlier entries are named "00_...", "01_..." and the last gets the plain name. Layers of one
    priority sort alphabetically, and the first wins (`rtx_option_layer.cpp:49-61`,
    `rtx_option_constants.h:159-164`).
  - `d3d9.*` and `dxvk.*` keys come from one merged config in which the last file wins.
- **Priorities:**
  - `dxvk.conf` layers 1, per-game built-ins 2 (only `hl2.exe` has an entry), `rtx.conf` layers 3,
    per-option environment variables 5;
  - `user.conf` 0xFFFFFFFE, presets 0xFFFFFFFF.
  - `user.conf` is always `./user.conf`; there is no override.
  - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA\RTXRemix\user_settings\<hash>.conf` holds only first-use and crash-report
    flags.
- **Save targets:**
  - "Remix Config (rtx.conf): Save" writes the last `DXVK_RTX_CONFIG_FILE` entry, every value of that
    layer, and only `rtx.` keys.
  - "User Settings (user.conf): Save" writes `./user.conf`.
  - "Migrate N Developer Settings" moves API-set values from the user layer into the `rtx.conf` layer,
    in memory only.
  - The RTX fixes write developer options through the API into the user layer: per-map configs,
    `ignoreGame*Lights`, texture categories. So `user.conf` shows unsaved changes by itself.
- **Presets:**
  - A graphics preset other than Custom (4) re-applies its values above `user.conf` at every device
    creation. Auto (5) picks Ultra on Blackwell.
  - DLSS preset On forces the upscaler, DLSS quality Auto and Reflex. `rtx.dlssPreset 2` keeps your
    choices.
  - `rtx.raytraceModePreset` Auto rewrites the three ray-trace modes.
- **Limits and switches:**
  - These variables are read into a 260-character buffer; a longer value counts as empty, and the
    runtime falls back to the bare root conf.
  - `DXVK_FORCE_WINDOWED=1` makes every device creation and Reset windowed (`d3d9_swapchain.cpp:1195`).
- **Texture-hash lists** (`rtx.*Textures`) combine across layers as sets: a layer adds its hashes and
  removes its `-0x...` ones. The classic install's effective lists hold 4,087 decal, 1,576 particle,
  549 player-model and 208 ignore hashes, removals included.
- **The fullscreen crash of section 18:**
  - `D3D9WindowProc` (`d3d9_swapchain.cpp:239-309`) keeps using a swap chain while the device
    destructor runs. The "Swapchain handle is invalid" liveness test is itself a use after free.
  - The hook is removed only at the end of the swap chain's destructor.

**What the field ran differently** (before this round):

- **Remix settings.** The package shipped the classic `rtx.conf` and `dxvk.conf`, but not the classic
  `user.conf`: 91 settings. That file holds the 4-hash `playerModelTextures`, the fog
  (`transmittanceMeasurementDistanceMeters` 420), atmosphere, NRC (`integrateIndirectMode` 2) and
  preset 4.
- **The user's test saves** in the field's root `rtx.conf` (16:58) set fog to 10 m, atmosphere off and
  `playerModel.enableInPrimarySpace` False.
- **The RTX add-ons' settings.**
  - GMod x64 keeps Lua convars in `garrysmod/cfg/client.vdf` and `server.vdf`, not `config.cfg`. The
    fixes also keep `r_forcehwskin` as a cookie in `cl.db`, restored at every map load. It is forced
    to 1 when HL2 RTX content is mounted.
  - The classic `client.vdf` (the fixes' own `.vdf`, which RTXLauncher copied, plus the user's tuning)
    against the field:

    | Setting | Classic | Field |
    |---|---|---|
    | `rtx_pseudoplayer`, `rtx_pseudoweapon` | 0 | 1 |
    | `rtx_api_map_lights_autospawn` | 0 | 1 |
    | `rtx_lightupdater` | 1 | 0 |
    | `rtx_flashlight_brightness` | 5 | 1000 |
    | `rtx_water_custom` | 1 | 0 |
    | `rtx_pseudoplayer_unique_hashes` (server) | 0 | 1 |

  - The field also had the cookie `r_forcehwskin=1`.
- **The pseudo player and Model Hotloader.**
  - With `rtx_pseudoplayer 1` the fixes draw a client-side copy of the local player. Model Hotloader
    adopts it as a player copy (`player_copies.lua:52-74`) and draws it with the character's own
    textures, so nothing is tagged and the MMD body appears in first person.
  - Model Hotloader also cuts the head out of the first-person view with a user clip plane, which the
    path tracer ignores. The field's Model Hotloader 2.3.0 has no RTX handling (no `mhrtx_*`
    variables); the classic install's 2.3.1 has.
- **AMAP's RTX flashlight** (`mmd_vmd_npc`, the Character Motion Importer) calls `RemixLight.CreateSphere`
  directly; ProjectedTexture and `rtx_lightupdater` do not matter to it. A sphere light's output grows
  with radius squared, and the field's `mmd_vmd_npc_flashlight_rtx_radius` was 1 (classic 30, AMAP
  default 20).
  - With the classic values the light is strong: the pinned frame went from mean RGB 80/82/76 to
    117/122/119.
- **The classic install's fixes Lua** has three local fixes the fork lacked, committed to the fork as
  `fc478c0`:
  - `cl_material_pipeline.lua` reads model materials from the `.mdl` header; the old walk froze maps
    with thousands of props;
  - the skybox boundary renderer builds its meshes only when switched on; before, it took 3 ms of each
    frame for a minute after every map load;
  - `func_reflective_glass` is removed again after clean-ups and saves.
- **Remix mods:** the classic install loads 29, the field 5. Among them are `Poolday` (337 MB, a
  "Release Ready" replacement mod for the pool rooms), `Water`, `Emissives`, `gmodrtx_poolday_fix`,
  `ai_pbr` and the user's character and map mods.

**Measurements** (block measure; repeat captures of the classic install: 0.60):

| Field state | block_diff | Mean RGB (classic 72.7/93.6/96.6) |
|---|---|---|
| Package with classic `rtx.conf` only, first-run add-on defaults applied (test 1) | 14.47 | 79.0/82.2/76.1 |
| One merged defaults layer, effective Remix values equal to the classic install's (test 2) | 14.79 | 80.0/81.8/76.1 |
| Texture lists merged as sets, every effective list equal (test 4) | 14.78 | 79.9/81.8/76.1 |
| Plus the classic `Poolday`, `Water`, `Emissives`, `gmodrtx_poolday_fix` and `SubUSDs` mods | 14.90 | 79.8/81.6/75.8 |

- The remaining difference is a uniform warm cast against the classic install's blue-grey. The
  effective Remix settings, the pool rooms mod and add-on, the water and the per-map configs are now
  identical; so are the hash lists.
- Not yet compared: the classic install's other local add-ons and their data, among them Advanced
  Material Editor (29 persistent rules, 32 RTX profiles, its standalone bridge DLL), the other 23
  Remix mods, and the older game build.
- The first-person view is correct: no pseudo-player body. Remix's menu opens through
  `RemixConfig.SetUIState(2)`, and "Remix API: ready" is reported under the loader.

**GMod's shared video settings across modes** (PoC, `-nonativeloader` for vanilla, `--no-window`):

- A normal start with `DXLevel_V1` 90 stored, as RTX leaves it, used the stored 2560x1440 windowed,
  kept it, and wrote 95.
- An RTX start with 95 stored opened at the loader's 3840x2160, left the stored size and window flags
  as they were, and wrote 90.
- So neither mode overwrites the other's video settings; command-line `-w`/`-h`/`-windowed` are not
  saved.

**The user's add-ons and the machine** (static audit of the field's local add-ons, about 700
Workshop GMAs and the binaries):

- **Add-ons:**
  - FPS Boost (2982286549) sets `r_threaded_particles 1` and the queued-rendering variables at every
    client start, after the session cfg.
  - Draconic Base (1847505933) turns motion blur on every second.
  - Draconic Base and ECAfEDAP draw stock post-processing; Zippy's Library draws outlines from screen
    copies.
- **Vulkan layers registered here** load into Remix's instance: OBS's `VK_LAYER_OBS_HOOK` and the AMD
  iGPU's `VK_LAYER_AMD_switchable_graphics` are always on. The Steam overlay and Fossilize layers turn
  on only when their `ENABLE_*` variables are set.
- **Other files:**
  - No `d3d11.dll` or `dxgi.dll` is in `bin\win64`; the Chromium leftovers there (`vk_swiftshader`,
    `dxcompiler.dll`, `dxil.dll`) are inert.
  - `gmcl_vrmod_win64.dll` in `lua\bin` links D3D11 and OpenVR, but no VRMod Lua is installed.
- **Zippy's Library** (Workshop 3146473253) is required by the user's local `enhanced_blood`. GMod's
  Workshop rules forbid reuploading another author's item "whatever the reupload reason is", so it is
  mounted from the user's own subscription in test sessions and never packaged.

**Bundling the requested add-ons** (inventory):

- **Model Hotloader:** its modules statically import `mmdhl_runtime_win64.dll`, which Windows finds
  in `bin\win64` next to the exe. The package format cannot place files there.
- **Advanced Material Editor, the bodygroup tool, procedural bodygroup destruction and the Character
  Motion Importer** are Lua add-ons, with an optional bridge DLL for the editor. They fit the package
  areas.
  - In the field, `mmd_hotloader`, `mmd_vmd_npc` and `advanced_bodygroup_tool` are hand-placed folders
    of the same names; the last is a link to the dev folder. The loader refuses to replace a folder it
    does not own, and that refusal fails the package.
- **The debug module** (`gmcl_rtxdebug_win64.dll`) and its one-file add-on `rtx_debug` now ship with
  the fixes.
- **modern_house_rtx:** 8 Lua files plus 490 DDS textures, 3.32 GB. The textures are AI-upscaled from
  the textures of someone else's map (Workshop 3495468649).

## 20. Third field round: the pseudo player, the classic Remix mods, Modern House (2026-10-29, Claude)

Measured in the field install with `poc_session.py --allow-steam-managed`. The evidence is in the
worktree's `out\round3\`.

**The player's own model in first person came back after round 2.**

- The classic install's `cfg\server.vdf` holds stale copies of three settings, and its `client.vdf`
  has the values the game uses:

  | Setting | `server.vdf` | `client.vdf` |
  |---|---|---|
  | `rtx_pseudoplayer` | `1` | `0` |
  | `rtx_pseudoweapon` | `1` | `0` |
  | `rtx_disablevertexlighting` | `1` | `0` |

- The fixes create these on the client only (`cl_rtx_misc.lua`, `CreateClientConVar`), and the
  field's `server.vdf` has no such entries. In single-player one variable of each name serves both
  realms.
- `classic_defaults.lua` version 2 had them in its server table. `nativeloader_rtx_defaults_server`,
  run after the client command, set them to `1`, and the game saved that in `client.vdf`. The pseudo
  player then drew the player's head in front of the camera.
- After the fix (version 3, the server table without names the client table has) the console prints
  `"rtx_pseudoplayer" = "0" ( def. "1" )`. A first-person start in the pool rooms shows no body.
  Version 3's first run changed 0 of 187 client and 0 of 17 server settings: they were classic already.

**Emissives** (`rtx-remix\mods\Emissives`, from the classic install; 10 files, 3.8 MB):

- It replaces one material, `mat_B19B22D6FDE30598`: albedo, an emissive mask, intensity 18, and
  metal and roughness maps.
- That is `models/props_interiors/florescentlight01a_on`, HL2's fluorescent tube light:
  - the fixes' category manager logs it with that hash in gm_construct;
  - `RemixMaterial.GetTextureHash` returns the same number in game;
  - the classic `rtx.conf` also lists it in `rtx.legacyEmissiveTextures`.
- gm_construct has 16 of these lights as static props, `models/props_interiors/lights_florescent01a.mdl`
  skin 1 (NikNaks `GetStaticProps`). 15 form a grid in the basement at z -179, x -1424 to -2704,
  y -1344 to -1824; one is at (-5460, -3164, 381).
- With the camera pinned at (-1584, -1584, -235), pitch -20, yaw 180:

  | | Mean RGB |
  |---|---|
  | With the mod | 49.5 / 45.8 / 38.6 |
  | Without it | 21.5 / 20.6 / 18.5 |

  The block measure between the two is 24.4, against 0.8 between two runs with it. Without the mod
  the tubes still glow (legacy emissive) but light little.
- Remix warns that its textures have no mip-maps. Four files are not referenced: three `.bmp` sources
  and `mirror_diffuse.dds`.

**Water** (`rtx-remix\mods\Water`, 38 files, 33 MB):

- It replaces 29 materials. All 29 textures are in the classic `rtx.ignoreTextures`, as well as in
  `animatedWaterTextures` and `decalTextures`. Ignored draws never reach the renderer, so the
  replacements never apply.
- Its `replacements.usda` references `./SubUSDs/AperturePBR_Translucent.usda`, which the folder lacks.
- `33FAB345028AFF4A`, one of its textures, belongs to the super gravity gun's sheet; no material uses it.
- **A/B in the pool rooms** at the round-2 pinned camera:

  | Compared with each baseline run | Block measure |
  |---|---|
  | Without Water | 0.88, 0.41 |
  | Without Emissives | 0.64, 0.89 |
  | The two baseline runs with each other | 0.90 |

  The largest 16-pixel block differences are 6-9 in every pair.
- **`SubUSDs`** at the mods root has no `mod.usda`; Remix does not load it.

**A test with props is misleading.** Fluorescent lights spawned as `ClientsideModel` with the `_on`
material rendered as solid red slabs, with the mod and without it. Test with the map's own props.

**gm_construct starts the player at different spawn points.** Three starts put the eye at (763, -801),
(643, -657) and (900, 578). Compare with a pinned camera.

**Modern House RTX through the Workshop** ([ADR 0023](decisions/0023-content-packages-and-modern-house-item.md)):

- **The build.** `package_content.py` built the package from the fork worktree in 9 s, with hard links
  in the work folder:
  - 500 files, 3,322,961,921 bytes; the archive is 3,323,148,599 bytes;
  - version `0.0.0-dev.202610280457+caaa4535`.
- **`nlctl` and hard links.** `nlctl manifest` refuses a package folder whose files are hard links ("is a
  link or reparse point; packages may not contain them"). The linked build is checked as the archive.
- **The upload.** `gmpublish create -addon <gma> -icon <512x512 baseline JPEG>` uploaded it in 50 s (shown
  as "3.0 GB"): item **3829275998**, "currently marked as hidden".
- **The subscription.** GMod's `steam_api64.dll` has the flat Steamworks API (`SteamAPI_InitSafe`,
  `SteamAPI_SteamUGC_v021`, `SteamAPI_ISteamUGC_SubscribeItem`, `..._DownloadItem`,
  `..._GetItemDownloadInfo`, `..._GetItemInstallInfo`). Run as app 4000 from a game root holding
  `steam_appid.txt`, it subscribed the owner to the hidden item.
  - Steam downloaded 2,414 MB, the transfer compressed, in 12 s.
  - It installed `content\4000\3829275998\modern-house-rtx.gma` byte-identical (the same SHA-256)
    and listed it in `appworkshop_4000.acf`.
- **The next start.** With the item allowlisted, the loader deployed it from the Workshop: 492 mod
  files and the add-on, `source: workshop`.
- **The map.** On `modern_house` (the map mounted with `--mount-workshop 3495468649`, then `--change-map`):
  - the add-on printed `[MHRTX] applied 9 Remix settings; sky: physical atmosphere` and `created: 341
    lights in the house, 341 on, the atmosphere's sun, 8 mirrors`, with no Lua errors;
  - from the launch to the screenshots took 2.1 minutes.
- **Against the gallery.** At the remaster's terrace camera (732, 154, 536; 6, 90, 0), the field matches
  its gallery shot from the classic install, mean RGB 139.4 / 122.3 / 102.6 against 139.8 / 122.2 / 103.0.
  The gallery shot has a wider field of view.
- **A harmless warning.** GMod printed `Couldn't write cache/map_pack.bsp to mount embedded content!`,
  and the map's textures were right anyway.

**Field changes this round:**

- The user's `enhanced_blood` moved to `garrysmod\addons_d` (their folder of disabled add-ons). With it
  went the need for Zippy's Library.
- The test copies of Water, SubUSDs and Emissives moved out of `rtx-remix\mods` into
  `out\round3\field-removed-mods`; the package now deploys Emissives.
- The round-2 copies of Poolday, `gmodrtx_poolday_fix` and `Poolday_mirror_fix` stay.

## 21. Fourth field round: the bundled add-ons and module dependencies (2026-10-29, Claude)

**Model Hotloader's natives** ([ADR 0024](decisions/0024-bundled-addons-and-module-dependencies.md)):

- **The import.** `gmcl_mmdhl_win64.dll` and `gmsv_mmdhl_win64.dll` statically import
  `mmdhl_runtime_win64.dll` (PE import tables). The runtime imports only system DLLs and loads
  `lib_coacd.dll` itself.
- **Who loads modules.** GMod's `lua_shared.dll` imports `LoadLibraryExA` and `LoadLibraryExW`;
  `client.dll` and `server.dll` import `LoadLibraryA` and `LoadLibraryExW`. Binary modules load without
  `LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH`, so Windows looks for the runtime next to `gmod.exe`. Model Hotloader's
  installer copies it into `bin\win64` for that reason; its import worker `mmdhl_worker.exe` finds the
  copy in `lua\bin`, beside itself.
- **The release layout.** Its release script (`scripts/package-dropin.py`) stages two drop-in trees:
  - `-win64-vulkan` carries a patched DXVK `d3d9.dll`;
  - `-win64-opengl-remix` leaves Direct3D 9 to Remix.

  Both hold `lua\bin\{gmcl,gmsv}_mmdhl_win64.dll`, `mmdhl_runtime_win64.dll`, `lib_coacd.dll`,
  `mmdhl_worker.exe` and `mmdhl-native-release.json` (the version file the add-on checks), plus
  `shaders\fxc\mmdhl_{ps20b,vs20}.vcs` and `bin\win64\mmdhl_runtime_win64.dll`. The add-on's own
  `shaders/fxc` has the same two shaders, byte for byte.
- **Releases.** The newest local release is 2.3.0 (build `1df48dac`, 2026-10-12). The repository's
  `main` is at "Version 2.3.1" (2026-10-26) with staged changes.
- **What the classic install runs.** Its `mmd_hotloader` folder matches the main repository's working
  tree. Its natives are byte-identical to the build in the worktree `wt-full-textures-props`
  (`gmcl_mmdhl_win64.dll` 2,843,648 bytes, 2026-10-26 16:21).

**The user's own Workshop items for the five add-ons**, all subscribed:

| Item | Add-on | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 3810025467 | Model Hotloader | 2.3.0 |
| 3718373357 | MMD VMD NPC Animation (the motion importer) | |
| 3789611737 | Procedural Bodygroup Destruction | 0.19.15 |
| 3791888631 | Advanced Bodygroup Tool | |
| 3793132326 | Advanced Material Editor | 57 files: its Lua and `materials/advmat/shift.png` |

**The parts**, built with `package_content.py`, add-ons filtered as gmad publishes them:

| Part | Files | Bytes | Left out by the filter | Compared with |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model Hotloader (add-on and six natives) | 110 | 86,924,394 | | |
| Advanced Material Editor (and its bridge) | 59 | 2,748,327 | 1,846 | 266 MB unfiltered: 14 character textures of 16 MB each committed under `materials/models/sheepylord/hsin`, which the published add-on leaves out (`--ignore materials/models/*`) |
| Advanced Bodygroup Tool | 6 | 212,124 | 37 | the Workshop's 212,438-byte GMA |
| Procedural Bodygroup Destruction | 16 | 753,816 | 16,714 | the local 0.20.0 GMA, 754,307 bytes |
| Character Motion Importer | 17 | 19,315,255 | | the Workshop's 19,334,061 bytes |

The combined RTX package with the nine parts is 1,541,278,091 bytes.

**Measured with loader 0.3.0:**

- **PoC, RTX:** deployed (234 changes). When the game loaded `gmsv_mmdhl_win64.dll`, the bootstrap first
  loaded `mmdhl_runtime_win64.dll` from `lua\bin` (`session.json`). Model Hotloader's native module is
  live on the server and the client (`mmdhl.native` set); no Lua errors.
- **PoC, without RTX:** the package's 16 add-on folders are hidden (`mmdhl` is nil and
  `lua/autorun/mmdhl.lua` is not in the `GAME` path). `require("mmdhl")` succeeds, with the runtime
  loaded first for `gmcl_mmdhl_win64.dll`. A subscribed Workshop copy can therefore use the bundled
  natives in a normal session.
- **Field, RTX:** deployed (407 changes) and active, no Lua errors, the module live on both sides. The
  first-person view in the pool rooms shows no body.
- **Field, moved out first** (the loader never replaces files it did not place):
  - `mmd_hotloader`, `mmd_vmd_npc` and the `advanced_bodygroup_tool` symlink went to `addons_d`;
  - the six Model Hotloader 2.3.0 files in `lua\bin` went to the round-4 backup. Three of them were hard
    links into a Model Hotloader validation folder (`!Gmodl_MMD_Hot_Loader\.claude\worktrees\
    mmd-importer-performance-87a36d\validation\multiplayer\client*`);
  - so did `bin\win64\mmdhl_runtime_win64.dll` (10,710,016 bytes, 2.3.0).

**The visibility-tuned fixes module.**
- Another session rebuilt `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary_win64.dll` (1,444,352 bytes, SHA-256 `189765c0...`,
  2026-10-28 21:19) in the fork worktree `rtx-remix-map-enhancement-bda9ac`. Its branch commit `e4d548d`
  is "Backrooms RTX: keep the room next door in the ray-traced scene" (`source/culling_patches.cpp`,
  +100 lines).
- It installed the module into the classic install's `lua\bin`, where the fixes part takes its modules,
  so the test package carries it byte for byte.
- The field had the earlier `485667b7...`.

**Hooks.** The add-on repositories (the bodygroup tool has none), the fixes fork and Model Hotloader's repository had no git
hooks. Their default branch is `main`, except the fork's checked-out `sheepylord/rtx-water-poolrooms`.

## 22. What Steam does when the user subscribes and unsubscribes (2026-10-29, Claude)

The user found that unsubscribing from the RTX item left RTX Remix running. To tell an unsubscribe
from a download or an update without the Steam API, a hidden test item (3829311605, a 100-byte
add-on package) was subscribed and unsubscribed. The scripts called GMod's own `steam_api64.dll` as
app 4000 (`ISteamUGC::SubscribeItem`, `UnsubscribeItem`, `GetItemState`, `DownloadItem`), polling
`steamapps\workshop\appworkshop_4000.acf` and the item folder every half second.

**Steam's record** has two sections under `AppWorkshop`:
- `WorkshopItemsInstalled`: the items on disk (`size`, `timeupdated`, `manifest`);
- `WorkshopItemDetails`: the items Steam tracks for this account (`manifest`, `timeupdated`,
  `timetouched`, `subscribedby` (an account id) and `latest_*`).

**Subscribe:**
- At 0.6 s the item state was `subscribed,needs-update`, with nothing on disk yet.
- At about 1.1 s the item was in `WorkshopItemDetails`, with `subscribedby`.
- At 8.5 s it was in `WorkshopItemsInstalled`, and its folder held the `.gma`.

So while a first download runs, the item is in `WorkshopItemDetails` with no folder.

**Unsubscribe:**
- The item state lost `subscribed` at once (`installed` only).
- The acf and the folder stayed as they were for the 90 s watched, both while the API session ran and
  after it ended.
- Some minutes later the item was gone from `WorkshopItemDetails`. It was still in
  `WorkshopItemsInstalled`, and the folder was still there.

**The next launch from Steam** (`steam://rungameid/4000`), timed from the launch request:
- At 1.2 s Steam had removed the item from `WorkshopItemsInstalled` and deleted its folder.
- At 2.8 s `gmod.exe` was running. The bootstrap therefore sees the item gone in its first start.
- A second run launched about 20 s after the unsubscribe, with the item still in both sections. At
  1.2 s Steam had removed it from both and deleted the folder, and `gmod.exe` ran at 2.0 s. The
  launch's clean-up does not wait for the later update of `WorkshopItemDetails`.

**Telling the cases apart:**
- A first download: the item is in `WorkshopItemDetails`, with no folder yet.
- An update: the item stays in `WorkshopItemsInstalled`, even while its folder is replaced.
- An unsubscribe, once Steam has cleaned up: the item is in neither section, and its folder is gone.

This is the rule [ADR 0025](decisions/0025-unsubscribe-removes-the-package.md) uses. A game started
without Steam's launch (for example `gmod.exe` run directly) finds the folder still there and keeps the
package until a launch from Steam has removed it.

**End to end with loader 0.3.1 on the PoC** (evidence in `out\round5\e2e`):
1. **Subscribed.** The item was installed in 1.7 s and allowlisted alone. The PoC start deployed it
   (generation 3), and the add-on's autorun printed on the server and the client.
2. **Unsubscribed, then launched from Steam at once.** Steam cleaned up as above. The next PoC start
   removed the package:
   - generation 4, with the note "its Workshop item was unsubscribed, so its files are deleted";
   - the skipped reason "not subscribed";
   - the add-on folder was gone, and the add-on did not run;
   - `native-loader` held only `config.json`, the journal, the lock, the install receipt and the logs,
     with no `packages` or `backup` folder;
   - the journal had no previous generation.
3. **The config put back.** The next PoC start deployed the 1.5 GB RTX package again in 10.0 s (669
   changes), RTX active, with no Lua errors.

`verify_install.py` afterwards: all 2,877 depot files unchanged.

**Seen on the way:** Model Hotloader prints "Missing bin/win64/mmdhl_runtime_win64.dll" and "The
loaded runtime DLL is not the file that was checked", on the server and the client
(`mmdhl.install.error.*`). Its runtime and both modules are loaded: the bootstrap loads the runtime
from `garrysmod\lua\bin` (ADR 0024), and the add-on says it "uses it anyway". The round-4 sessions,
PoC and field, show the same lines. Fixed in section 23.

## 23. Model Hotloader's install check and the runtime in lua/bin (2026-10-29, Claude)

**Where the warnings come from.** Model Hotloader's repository is
`H:\BACKUP_20260815\Modding\ipg\!GMHLVK\Gmod-Model-Hotloader-with-Vulkan` (`main` at `ecd7c42`
"Version 2.3.1"). Its `addon/lua/mmdhl/installation.lua`:
- **Before loading,** `EvaluateInstallation` reads the runtime where Windows looks for it: `bin/win64`
  through `BASE_PATH` on a client or listen server, beside `srcds_win64.exe` then `bin/win64` on a
  dedicated server, `lua/bin` on Linux. A missing file is a warning, printed before `require`.
- **After loading,** `identitiesMatch` compares the runtime path the native module reports
  (`GetInstallationInfo`) with that file. A difference is the "loaded runtime DLL is not the file that
  was checked" warning.

With the loader, the runtime the module reports is `<game>\garrysmod\lua\bin\mmdhl_runtime_win64.dll`
(LoadLibraryExW of that absolute path, `loader/proxy/modules.cpp` `load_first`). So both warnings
fire, although everything works.

**What the RTX package ships.** The classic install's `garrysmod\addons\mmd_hotloader` equals the
repository's `main` working tree, byte for byte, except `lua/mmdhl/native_policy.lua`:
- The working tree holds work staged since 2026-10-26: 41 files, secondary gravity and buoyancy,
  server settings. It is uncommitted; the session that wrote it is offline.
- The shipped `native_policy.lua` is the one the native build writes. It records release 2.3.1 (build
  `ecd7c426c0b5-20261026T225907Z`, runtime SHA-256 `351a7068...`), which is what the classic install's
  `lua\bin` holds. The committed one stops at 2.3.0.

**The fix** (Model Hotloader commit `bed4582`, made on the branch `claude/runtime-in-lua-bin`;
[ADR 0026](decisions/0026-addon-file-from-its-repository.md)):
- **Before loading:** on a Windows client or listen server with no runtime in `bin/win64` and a copy
  in `lua/bin`, that copy is the runtime checked. The missing file waits in `files.runtime.missingAt`.
- **After loading:** `reportMissingRuntime` drops it when the loaded runtime is that copy. Otherwise
  (nothing loaded, loaded from elsewhere, a module too old to say) the missing file is reported as
  before, so a player without the loader still reads why the module did not load.
- **Tests:** its offline suite (51 scripts, lupa 2.8) and the i18n check pass on the branch. On `main`'s
  working tree with the staged work, 55 scripts pass.
- **Landed** (the user: "Push to main"):
  - Model Hotloader's `main` was fast-forwarded from `ecd7c42` to `bed4582` and pushed to GitHub, and
    the branch was deleted.
  - The checkout's staged work is kept, now on top of the fix: the same 41 files and changed lines,
    compared before and after. A backup of the earlier state is in `out\round6\mmdhl-main-backup`.
  - 55 scripts pass there.

**Measured** with the branch-built RTX package on the PoC (loader 0.3.1, RTX active), evidence in
`out\round6\poc`:
- No runtime warning on either realm.
- `mmdhl.native` is set on the server and the client.
- The server's install status lists no issue. The client's lists only `game_unverified`: "This Garry's
  Mod build has not been tested with this native release (engine.dll, client.dll, materialsystem.dll,
  shaderapidx9.dll changed)". That is Model Hotloader's compatibility profile for 2.3.1 against a
  newer GMod build, unrelated to the runtime.

**Git hooks and the publish script.** Git runs a hook with the hooked repository in `GIT_DIR`,
`GIT_INDEX_FILE` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` (githooks(5); for a worktree, `GIT_DIR` is
`.git/worktrees/<name>`). `git -C <path>` and a `cwd` do not override `GIT_DIR`.
- So the round-4 source hooks ran `publish_workshop.py` against the source repository.
- Seen when the fix above was committed in Model Hotloader's worktree: the run refused with this
  repository's `companion/` and `tools/...` listed as untracked. Its log was in
  `Gmod-Model-Hotloader-with-Vulkan\out\workshop\logs`, which was then removed.
- No earlier source-repository commit had run one (no other such log existed).
- The 15 names `git rev-parse --local-env-vars` lists on git 2.56.0 are the ones the script now
  removes.

## 24. The seventh field round: Draconic's motion blur, GMod's Workshop mount, subscribed content (2026-10-29, Claude)

**"Disabling motion blur will break addons' effects..." every second.**
- It is not GMod's: no game DLL or depot Lua has the line. A scan of the Lua inside all 677 installed
  `.gma` archives found it in Draconic Base (1847505933), `lua/draconic/cl/library.lua:242-248`.
- Once a second (`rt > MBlurCheck`, then `+1`), if `GetConVar("mat_motion_blur_enabled"):GetInt() < 1`,
  it prints the line and runs `LocalPlayer():ConCommand("mat_motion_blur_enabled 1")` and
  `ConCommand("mat_motion_blur_strength 0")`. It cites garrysmod-requests issue 2110.
- The companion's guard pins `mat_motion_blur_enabled` at 0 in RTX sessions (ADR 0022) and drops that
  command, so the check failed every second. GMod caches `GetConVar` objects per name
  (`lua/includes/util.lua:574`), so the guard recognizes the convar by identity.

**GMod's Workshop mount at start**, measured at the main menu with no map requested (the PoC, 755
subscriptions):
- 4.0 s: `Mounted 0 of 755 workshop addons!`, before Steam has listed the subscriptions.
- 5.0 s: `Addons have changes - remounting`, then for each native-loader package
  `Couldn't mount addon file '<path>' from '<title>' (<id>)`.
- 7.0 s: `Mounted 752 of 755 workshop addons!`.
- A map on the command line (`+map`) in a session with Workshop add-ons waits on that fetch: the
  window shows "Fetching Subscriptions... 0 of 755" and "Waiting for Steam Workshop to finish...", and
  goes Not Responding. One such run exited -1 after 21 s with an empty `console.log`. The user had seen
  agents do this nine times. `poc_session.py` now starts such runs at the menu.

**Why GMod's addon list shows the packages red.**
- `html/js/menu/control.Addons.js:488` adds the class `invalid` (`html/css/Workshop.css:484`,
  `#d22`) when the item from `engine.GetAddons()` has an `invalid_reason`. GMod sets that when it cannot
  mount the archive, and a native-loader package cannot be mounted: its files are under `native/`,
  which GMod's Workshop whitelist does not take.
- The menu state loads a fixed list of files (`lua/menu/menu.lua`, `includes/init_menu.lua`): no
  plugin folder, and this build has no `lua_run_menu` (the binaries hold only `lua_run` and
  `lua_run_cl`). So nothing of ours can run in the menu state without editing depot files or
  injecting code into `lua_shared.dll` from the bootstrap.
- The console line comes from `filesystem_stdio.dll` (format `Couldn't mount addon file '%s' from
  '%s' (%llu)`). It imports `Warning`, `Msg`, `DevMsg`, `DevWarning`, `ConColorMsg` and
  `LoggingSystem_Log` from `tier0.dll`. GMod's x64 `tier0.dll` exports the `LoggingSystem_*` API, but
  not `SpewOutputFunc`, `GetSpewOutputFunc`, `WarningV` or `MsgV`.

**Native-loader packages among the subscriptions** (ADR 0027):
- Reading the index of all 677 installed `.gma` archives (98,793 entries) for `native/manifest.json`
  took 0.29 s in Python, warm. It found three packages, each listing the manifest first: 3829070317 (the
  RTX package), 3829275998 (Modern House RTX) and 3829348717 (Guinaifen RTX).
- What they deploy, by area:

  | Package | `garrysmod/addons` | `rtx-remix/mods` | Elsewhere |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Guinaifen RTX | 28 `dat`, 2 `json` | 44 `dds`, 2 `usda` | |
  | Modern House RTX | 6 `lua`, 1 `json`, 1 `vtf` | 490 `dds`, 2 `usda` | |
  | RTX package | `lua`, `vtf`, `vmt`, `dat`, `png`, `json` and more | `dds`, `usda`, `bmp`, `mdl`, `txt` | `garrysmod/lua/bin`: 8 `dll`, 1 `exe`, 1 `json`; 191 payload files |
- Guinaifen's manifest: id `guinaifen-rtx`, kinds `lua-addon` and `root-files`, roots
  `garrysmod/addons/mmdhl_guinaifen` and `rtx-remix/mods/pbr_guinaifen`, no `remix` section.

## 25. Translated Remix menus: the runtime fork's i18n (2026-10-29, Claude)

**Where the runtime comes from.**
- The fork's main checkout (`H:\BACKUP_20260815\Modding\dxvk-remix-gmod`, branch `gmod-1.6.1` at
  `c6b48ed1`) is in the middle of merging tag `remix-1.6.1` (`MERGE_HEAD` `1e6d66c6`, since
  2026-10-25 03:33; `submodules/rtxdi` unresolved, with 3 modified files in the submodule). 415
  tracked files differ from `HEAD`, 4 are untracked.
- No source file is newer than `_CompRelease_x64\src\d3d9\d3d9.dll` (2026-10-27 11:32:17, SHA-256
  `A8E39D93...`, the runtime of `runtime-b4`): that working tree is its source.
- The translation work is branch `claude/remix-i18n` in the worktree
  `dxvk-remix-gmod\.claude\worktrees\remix-i18n`: one snapshot commit of that working tree (not a
  real merge; submodules are junctions to the main checkout's), then the i18n commit. Its
  `_CompRelease_x64` is configured like the main one (`-Dbuildtype=release -Dbackend=ninja
  -Denable_tracy=false -Ddownload_apics=False -Dremix_with_shim=false`); meson 1.12.1 runs as
  `python -m mesonbuild.mesonmain`, MSVC through `tools\lib\VsDevEnv.psm1`.
- A full build of the snapshot in the fresh worktree took **3.9 min** (32 threads, configure
  included); after a `.po` edit **0.2-0.7 min**.

**The menus' text and fonts.**
- ImGui is vendored **1.88 WIP** (`src/dxvk/imgui`), with stb_truetype 1.26 (reads CFF OpenType).
- The atlas had only ASCII: NVIDIA Sans App Medium/Bold (letters and symbols) with Roboto Mono
  digits merged, 16 px; Bold also 24 px for the large UI mode.
- NVIDIA Sans App 3.000 maps 492 characters: Latin-1 (all but U+00A6, U+00B5), 102 of Latin
  Extended-A, U+0400-045F complete; no arrows or math symbols (→ ≤ ≥ ≈ ∞). French and Russian
  need no other font.
- Fonts with CJK glyphs on this machine under the SIL OFL 1.1 (licence in the name table):
  - SteamVR's `tools\steamvr_environments\game\steamtours\panorama\fonts\notosans{sc,tc,jp,kr}-regular.otf`,
    Noto Sans SC/TC/JP/KR 1.004, static Regular, CFF; KR has all 11,172 hangul syllables;
  - Windows 11's `C:\Windows\Fonts\NotoSansSC-VF.ttf` and `NotoSansJP-VF.ttf`, variable fonts whose
    default instance is weight 100 (no TC, no KR).
- ImGui sizes a font by its line height, (hhea ascender - descender) / unitsPerEm: NVIDIA Sans
  1.26 em, Noto Sans CJK 1.48 em. Merged at the same pixel size, CJK glyphs come out 15% smaller, so
  they are merged at 16 x 1.48 / 1.26 = 18.8 px (same em).
- The menus' text: 2,949 messages, 39,034 English words; 969 are descriptions of options the menus
  bind (of 1,253 options declared).

**Measured on the PoC (RTX 5090, 1600x900 window).**
- `RemixConfig` (the fixes' Lua table) exists only with add-ons mounted: the fixes package deploys
  its Lua as add-ons, and `poc_session.py run` passes `-noaddons` unless `--addons`.
- A language change applies at the next frame: the Remix log has `[i18n] menu language: zh-CN`
  and, one frame later, the rebuilt atlas 40-50 ms after it.
- The font atlas (RGBA8, regular 16 px, bold 16 px and large 24 px fonts, CJK merged with
  `OversampleH = 1`):

  | Language | Atlas | Glyphs |
  |---|---|---|

  | fr | 512x512 | 444 |
  | ru | 512x512 | 543 |

- The session that switched through every language (`out\i18n\sessions\t5`) quit normally. Its Remix
  log has the same errors as runtime-b4 sessions of the same evening: `GetShaderModule: Out of range
  of supported shader model` (the classic `dxvk.conf`'s `d3d9.shaderModel = 0`, section 11), the
  Neural Radiance Cache failing to initialise, and 47 common device objects not disposed at exit.
- A process that is not DPI-aware sees the 1600x900 game window as 800x450 at 200 % scaling, and
  `PrintWindow` into a bitmap of that size captures only the top-left quarter;
  `poc_session.py` calls `SetProcessDPIAware()` for this reason.
- Mouse messages posted to the game window reach the menus: the fork forwards them to ImGui from

## 26. ReShade with the Remix runtime (2026-10-29, Claude)

**The test client.** `H:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod_ReShade`, made with
`make_vanilla_copy.py` from the field install: 2,877 depot files, 7,279,873,012 bytes, all verified, in
about two minutes. Loader 0.4.0 and 0.5.0, the RTX package from Workshop item 3829070317.

**ReShade 6.8.0**, from reshade.me: `ReShade_Setup_6.8.0.exe` (4,075,064 bytes, SHA-256 `207AEA16...`,
signed "ReShade"). The setup carries a ZIP at its end with `ReShade32.dll`, `ReShade64.dll` (5,255,448
bytes, version 6.8.0.2158), `ReShade32.json`, `ReShade64.json` and the `_XR.json` OpenXR manifests.
`ReShade64.json` is the layer `VK_LAYER_reshade` (library `.\ReShade64.dll`, API 1.3.268,
`disable_environment` `DISABLE_VK_LAYER_reshade_1`). For Direct3D 9 the setup puts the DLL next to the
executable as `d3d9.dll`, with `ReShade.ini`, `ReShadePreset.ini` and `reshade-shaders` beside it; for
Vulkan it copies the files to `C:\ProgramData\ReShade` and registers the manifests under
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers` (administrator rights). This machine has no such
registration (OBS, the Steam overlay and Fossilize only); its Vulkan loader is 1.4.341.

**What ReShade's source says** (tag `v6.8.0`):
- Base folder (`source/dll_main.cpp:55-73`): `[INSTALL] BasePath` from a `ReShade.ini` beside the
  executable (resolved against the DLL's folder, must exist), else `RESHADE_BASE_PATH_OVERRIDE` (same
  rules), else the executable's folder for a DLL with a non-proxy name and the DLL's folder for
  `d3d*`, `dxgi`, `opengl32`, `dinput*` and `.asi`. `ReShade.ini` and the log (`ReShade.log`, then
  `.log1`... when it is taken) live there.
- A DLL with a non-proxy name loads only where that folder has a `ReShade.ini`, unless
  `RESHADE_DISABLE_LOADING_CHECK` is set (`:129-140`): this keeps the global layer out of other games.
- A second ReShade in a process fails its own load (`DllMain` returns FALSE) when another module
  exports `ReShadeVersion` (`:201-212`).
- Vulkan is reached only through the layer mechanism; every name loads the Direct3D and DXGI hooks
  (for system DLLs). The layer's own name appears only in `vkGetPhysicalDeviceToolPropertiesEXT`
  (`source/vulkan/vulkan_hooks_instance.cpp:286`), so a manifest may name the layer differently.
- Settings paths are resolved against the base folder (`resolve_path`, `source/runtime.cpp`):
  `EffectSearchPaths`, `TextureSearchPaths` (default `.\`), `IntermediateCachePath` (default the
  temporary folder), `PresetPath` (default `.\ReShadePreset.ini`), `StartupPresetPath`,
  `PresetShortcutPaths`, `[SCREENSHOT] SavePath` and `PostSaveCommandWorkingDirectory` (default `.\`),
  `SoundPath`, the `[STYLE]` fonts and `[ADDON] AddonPath` (default: the base folder; the log says
  "Searching for add-ons (*.addon, *.addon64) in" it). ReShade writes the whole file back when it exits.
- The built-in add-ons "Generic Depth" and "Effect Runtime Sync" are left out with
  `[ADDON] DisabledAddons=<name>` (`source/addon_manager.cpp:155-190`).
- ReShade's licence texts of its libraries are compiled in and shown on the overlay's About page
  (`source/runtime_gui.cpp:3147-3236`).

**Compatibility, measured** (gm_construct, the RTX package's add-ons mounted, a marker effect of ours
that paints the bottom-right 48 x 48 pixels magenta):
- RTX on, ReShade for Direct3D 9 in `bin\win64`: the game process lists the runtime's `d3d9.dll` and no
  ReShade; no marker. ReShade's log shows it loaded into GMod's Chromium helper (it loads `d3d9.dll` by
  name), as it does without the loader. Its three files kept their SHA-256 through every RTX session.
- RTX off (`remix.enabled` false): the game binds `bin\win64\d3d9.dll`, the marker shows, 1,137 frames a
  second at 1280 x 720. The helper loads it too (`ReShade.log1`).
- RTX on, ReShade 6.8.0 as a layer (`VK_ADD_LAYER_PATH`, `VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS`,
  `RESHADE_BASE_PATH_OVERRIDE`): ReShade takes the runtime's `vkCreateInstance` and its
  `vkCreateSwapchainKHR` calls (the runtime asks for the immediate and FIFO present modes), compiles the
  effects, and the marker shows in the path-traced frame with DLSS frame generation on (the default:
  `rtx.dlfg.enable = True`, two generated frames) and off.
- The Chromium helper inherits the variables: the Direct3D 9 ReShade in it then logs to the layer's
  folder. `mmdhl_worker.exe` (Model Hotloader) imports no Vulkan, so the layer cannot reach it.

**Frame rate** (`poc_session.py --fps 30`, the camera pinned, `fps_max 0`, `engine_no_focus_sleep 0`,
RTX 5090, frames counted by the engine; DLSS frame generation shows about three times as many):

| When | Case | 1280 x 720 | 3840 x 2160 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 02:25-02:52, another session building the runtime and packing `.gma` files | without ReShade | 138-146 | 86-90 |
| same | ReShade layer, no effect / marker / heavy blur | 75-95 | 31 (overlay open) / 71 (blur) |
| 02:59-03:07, quiet machine | without ReShade | 145.0 | |
| same | ReShade layer, marker | 143.2-145.0 (four runs) | |
| 03:09-03:45, quiet machine, final batch | without ReShade | 136.4, 148.2 | 90.0, 90.3 |
| same | ReShade layer, no effect | 145.2 | |
| same | ReShade layer, marker | 145.0, 147.6 | 84.2, 83.2 |
| same | ReShade layer, heavy blur | 147.0 | 71.6 |

- The early drop is not the layer's own cost: on a quiet machine the 1280 x 720 runs with and without
  the layer are alike (143-148 frames a second; one run without it gave 136), whatever the effect.
  The layer's work runs on the runtime's command threads, so it suffers most from a processor other
  work keeps busy; runs without the layer lost about 3 % in the same window.
- At 3840 x 2160 the layer costs frame time: the median frame took 11.04-11.09 ms without ReShade,
  11.87-12.00 ms with the marker (0.9 ms more, 7 % fewer frames) and 13.82 ms with the heavy blur
  (2.8 ms more, 20 % fewer).
- The final batch (`out\round8\perf_final.ps1`, not in git) waited before each run until no game of
  another install ran and the processor had been under 15 % busy for 10 s, and recorded that no other
  game started during a run (processor 9-16 % busy on average while timing).
- Starting ReShade from a `ReShade.ini` with or without its overlay layout made no difference (143-145
  both), and ReShade rewrote it only at start and exit (three writes a run).
- One 4K run with the layer stayed at 31 frames a second for its whole 30 s; its `ReShade.ini`
  afterwards held the overlay's windows at 4K size, so the overlay was open (the window covered the
  screen). The final runs give the overlay a key nobody presses.

## 27. The runtime's late DLLs, and GPUs that are not NVIDIA's (2026-10-29, Claude and a side session)

**FSR and NRC never loaded under the loader.** From the Remix logs and module lists kept under `out\`:
- The classic install (`m5\acceptance\ref-*`) and the M4 loader runs log "FSR: amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll
  loaded" and "NRC SDK: Loading the default network config data"; its game process has
  `amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll`, `cudart64_13.dll`, `nvrtc64_130_0.dll`, `nvrtc-builtins64_133.dll`,
  `nvcuda.dll` and `nvcudart_hybrid64.dll` loaded.
- Every loader session from M5 (`m5\acceptance\poc-construct-2`) on logs "FSR: amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll
  could not be loaded" and "[RTX Neural Radiance Cache] Failed to initialize NRC. Reason: Unexpected
  condition occured during processing", and switches to importance-sampled indirect light; none of
  those six DLLs is in its process.
- The four of them that ship are in the package's `runtime` folder beside `d3d9.dll`. The fork probes
  FSR by bare name when it creates the device (`src\dxvk\rtx_render\rtx_fork_fsr.cpp:537`, a plain
  `LoadLibraryA`; the DLL is delay-loaded, `src\dxvk\meson.build:523`). `NRC_Vulkan.dll` delay-imports
  `nvrtc64_130_0.dll` and names `nvrtc-builtins64`; nothing in the runtime folder names `cudart64_13`
  (ASCII or UTF-16). In the classic process (`ref-construct-3`) the CUDA DLLs are the last modules to
  load, `cudart64_13.dll` just before `nvrtc64_130_0.dll`.
- M4 put the runtime folder into the search with `SetDllDirectoryW`, and FSR and NRC loaded. M5 moved
  it to `PATH` (ADR 0010). Loader 0.5.0's first fix added it with `AddDllDirectory` as well: the
  end-to-end run (`out\round8\e2e\sessions-run1`, four RTX sessions with and without ReShade) still
  logged both failures, with `AddDllDirectory` succeeding (no note).

**Why no search finds the runtime folder** (2026-10-29, measured on the ReShade client):
- **`PATH` is rewritten.** Read from the running game's process environment block, `PATH` was
  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam;` followed by the 25 entries the process started with: neither the
  runtime folder the loader put first nor `gmod.exe`'s own `bin\win64` entry is left, so something
  rewrites it after both from the starting value, apparently the Steam client.
- **`gmod.exe` rewrites it too, harmlessly:** it formats `PATH=%s;%s` (its folder, then the `PATH` it
  read; code at `0x14005736E`, with warnings for a game path of 260 characters or more and for the two
  together passing 8,192) and then checks the command line for `--type=` (Chromium's helper processes).
- **The standard search is in effect.** `gmod.exe` holds Chromium's sandbox mitigations; their
  DLL-search flag (`0x200`) calls `SetDefaultDllDirectories(0xC00)` (System32 and user folders;
  `0x1400018FA`, the function name resolved at run time, so no import table shows it). Under that set
  an `AddDllDirectory` folder would be searched; since the game's loads did not find the folder, they
  use the standard search, which reads `SetDllDirectory`'s folder (M4) but never `AddDllDirectory`'s.
  Modules of the game process that name these functions: `gmod.exe`, `libcef.dll` (both
  `SetDefaultDllDirectories`), `apphelp.dll`, `client.dll`, `server.dll`, `GameAnalytics.dll`
  (`AddDllDirectory`), and `gmcl_rtxfixesbinary_win64.dll`, `dxgi.dll`, `NvMemMapStoragex.dll`
  (`SetDllDirectory`).
- **The files are fine.** In a fresh process (`out\round8\tools\probe_search*.py`), all of
  `amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll`, `cudart64_13.dll` and `nvrtc64_130_0.dll` load from the deployed runtime
  folder: by bare name with it first on `PATH`; by bare name after `AddDllDirectory` and
  `SetDefaultDllDirectories(0xC00)`, also after a DXGI adapter list and a Vulkan instance on the NVIDIA
  driver, and after any `SetDllDirectoryA` call; and by absolute path. Their dependencies are System32's
  (`MSVCP140`, `VCRUNTIME140`, `vulkan-1`), the same files the game loads.
- So loader 0.5.0 loads the four right after the runtime, by absolute path (ADR 0030): a later
  bare-name load binds to the loaded module. They are 113 MB (`nvrtc64_130_0.dll` 96.7 MB,
  `amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll` 8.9 MB, `nvrtc-builtins64_133.dll` 6.4 MB, `cudart64_13.dll` 0.5 MB).
- **Result** (`out\round8\e2e\sessions`, the same package, RTX 5090): every RTX session logs "FSR:
  amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll loaded.", "NRC SDK: Loading the default network config data" and "NRC v0.15
  (25 March 2026) Context successfully initialized", and stays on the Neural Radiance Cache. Activation
  took 38.8 ms with the four against 35.8-51.1 ms without them.
- **In the field install** (2026-10-29, `out\round8\field`): loader 0.5.0 in place of 0.4.0, the same
  package from the Workshop, two sessions with the user's add-ons and Workshop items.
  - The first start deployed generation 17 (200 changes, 16,637 file operations, 5.2 s) and activated
    the runtime in 45 ms with the four preloaded. The second found nothing to deploy (start-up 0.25 s,
    activation 40 ms).
  - Both log "FSR: amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll loaded." and NRC's "Context successfully initialized".
    Round 7's field session (`out\round7\field`) logged both failures and ran on importance-sampled
    indirect light.
  - Ray tracing began 20-22 s after the map loaded, so the first run's screenshot, taken seconds
    later, is black (1 FPS). The second run (`--settle 60`) shows gm_construct path-traced (mean RGB
    116, 111, 97).
  - All 2,877 depot files still verify, `autoexec.cfg` aside.

**The preset.** The package's classic layer pins `rtx.graphicsPreset = 4` (Custom). The fork's
`GraphicsPreset` (`rtx_graphics_preset.h:26`) is Ultra 0, High 1, Medium 2, Low 3, Custom 4, Auto 5. It
chooses per GPU only under Auto (`rtx_options.cpp:419`, `rtx_initializer.cpp:128`): for a non-NVIDIA
GPU, Low with `applyNonNvidiaDefaults` (resolution scale 0.5, TAA-U and NIS at Performance;
`rtx_gpu_profile.cpp:203-209`, `rtx_options.cpp:450-460`). Per-GPU overrides
(`rtx.gpuOverride.graphicsPreset.VVVV_DDDD`, `rtx_gpu_overrides.h:38`) name one vendor and device id
each and are read only under Auto.

**What an AMD GPU needs** (the fork, read by the side session):
- Required are only the KHR ray-tracing extensions (`dxvk_extensions.h:326-328`: acceleration
  structure, ray query, ray-tracing pipeline). The NVIDIA extensions (invocation reorder, low latency,
  NVX binary import and image view handle, present metering) are optional. So Radeon RX 6000, 7000
  and 9000 qualify; RX 5000 and older cannot start an RTX session.
- DLSS becomes TAA-U when unsupported (`rtx_context.cpp:579-580`), NRC becomes ReSTIR GI
  (`rtx_options.cpp:500-506`); DLSS frame generation and Reflex are NVIDIA-only; XeSS (`libxess.dll`,
  a static import) runs on AMD.
- On AMD, asynchronous shader prewarming is off (`rtx_initializer.cpp:205`, an old deadlock
  workaround): expect a stutter the first time each effect is used.
- Integrated GPUs are skipped only when a discrete GPU is there (`dxvk_instance.cpp:919`); on an APU-only
  machine Remix uses the integrated GPU.

**AMD smoke test** (2026-10-29, `out\round8\amd_smoke.ps1`, twice: before and after the preload). One
RTX session in the ReShade client with `VK_DRIVER_FILES` set to AMD's driver manifest, so Vulkan sees
only the Ryzen 9 9950X3D's integrated "AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics" (vendor `0x1002`, RDNA 2). DXGI still
lists the RTX 5090, so the non-NVIDIA layer stayed off and the preset Custom (4).
- Remix took the Radeon, found NRC unsupported (`VK_NVX_binary_import` and `VK_NVX_image_view_handle`
  missing) and switched to ReSTIR GI; NGX was not available (DLSS off) and Reflex failed; "AMD driver
  detected" set the ray-tracing modes (trace ray for indirect light, ray query for the G-buffer and
  direct light). The map loaded.
- With the preload, "FSR: amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll loaded." (before it, "could not be loaded").
- In both runs: many "GetShaderModule: Out of range of supported shader model", then the fork's FSR
  sharpening pass (`fork_rcas`) failed to compile and, a second later, `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` (60-75 s
  after start). The game then hung until stopped; `poc_session.py`'s timeout did not end it. So this
  integrated GPU cannot run an RTX session; a discrete Radeon (RX 6000 or newer) was not available to try.

## 28. The physical sky, time of day and weather (2026-10-29, Claude)

The user's request: environmental control in the RTX settings (the sun's direction, the time of day,
clouds and weather), looking realistic. Built in the companion ([ADR 0031](decisions/0031-physical-sky-time-and-weather.md));
evidence in `out\sky\sessions` (e1-e7: exploration tours, the end-to-end run, the frame-rate run).

**What sessions had before.**

- **The sky mode.** The runtime has two (`rtx_options.h:175`): 0 rasterises the game's skybox into a
  probe; 1, "Numos", is a physical sky (`rtx_atmosphere.*`):
  - Hillaire scattering, Nubis-style volumetric clouds with a second layer, stars, up to four moons;
  - lightning, and rain/snow/sand particles (`rtx_precipitation.*`);
  - in Numos mode the sun and the moons are distant lights the atmosphere adds itself
    (`RtxAtmosphere::syncDistantLights`).

  The RTX fixes' `rtx.conf` has `rtx.skyMode = 0` and `rtx.ignoreGameDirectionalLights = False`.
- **The package's Remix defaults layer** (`01_classic_remix_defaults.conf`, ADR 0021) carries the
  classic install's `user.conf`, which holds what Modern House RTX once pushed through the API:
  - `rtx.skyMode 1`, `rtx.ignoreGameDirectionalLights True`;
  - the sun: `sunElevation 21`, `sunRotation 222`;
  - the clouds: `cloudCoverageMean 0.27`, `cloudCoverageSpread 0.8`, `cloudTypeMean 0.9`,
    `cloudShadowStrength 0`, `cloudVoxelShadowsEnable False`, `cloudLayer2CoverageMean 0.35`;
  - the fog: `rtx.volumetrics.anisotropy 0.55`, `transmittanceMeasurementDistanceMeters 420`.

  So every map ran that one sunny afternoon, with no cloud shadows.
- **Live values are not saved by themselves.** Remix's per-game settings file
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA\RTXRemix\user_settings\<hash>.conf`) holds only the consent switches, and
  API values reach `user.conf` only through Remix's Save.

**The atmosphere's conventions** (`rtx_atmosphere.cpp`):

- `sunRotation` and a moon's `rotation` are bearings: degrees from the map's +y towards +x
  (`toWorld` in `syncDistantLights` swaps y and z under `rtx.zUp`).
- **The runtime's day cycle** (`timeCycleEnable`, `timeOfDayHours`, `latitudeDegrees`, `dayOfYear`,
  `northOffsetDegrees`) places only the sun (`getAtmosphereArgs`, lines 579-586). With the cycle off,
  `timeOfDayHours` is ignored, whatever its description says. The moons' position and phase and
  `starRotation` are for the game to push.
- **Moon phase** runs 0 (new) to 0.5 (full) to 1; the lit side faces the sun (`atmosphere_sky.slangh`,
  `getPhaseIllumination`).
- **The star field** is rotated about the pole axis (`starAxisElevation`, `starAxisRotation`) by
  rotating the sampled direction (`evalStarField`), so it appears to turn the other way.
- **Moonlight** scales with the disc's solid angle (`moonSolidAngleSr` in `syncDistantLights`).
  - The option `angularRadius` is in fact a diameter in degrees, 3.5 by default.
  - At 1.2 degrees the ground went nearly black.
  - At 1.6 degrees the ground's share (`surfaceMoonBrightness`, 50) needs (3.5 / 1.6)^2 = 4.8 times
    as much, 240, to keep the default night. At 1,100, the fourth power, a moonlit field blew out
    white.
  - The runtime gives the moon full strength as soon as the sun is down (`nightFactor`, the sun
    0.02 to -0.05 in its sine). At dusk (the sun 5 degrees down) a rising full moon lit gm_construct's
    towers bright orange, the brightest thing in the view, even at 240. Real moonlight is about a
    fiftieth of civil twilight's light.
- **The ground below the horizon** is the virtual planet with a constant albedo
  (`atmosphere_common.slangh:73`, `kGroundAlbedo = 0.3`). From high up, where the map has no geometry,
  it shows as a flat band, red at sunset.

**Weather** (`rtx_weather.*`):

- **The presets.** There are twelve, of 63 fields each. A field the runtime lists in
  `FALLBACK_IF_INVARIANT` is taken over only when the presets disagree on it; 27 fields are the same
  in all twelve.
- **The blender** is driven by `remixapi_SetGameValue("__weather.target", <name>)`
  (`rtx_remix_api.cpp:2831`); `SetConfigVariable` cannot reach it.
- **What Lua can reach.** The RTX fixes' Lua API has no `SetGameValue`, and its `GetConfigVariable`
  reads `rtx.conf` from disk (`source/remixapi/remixapi.cpp:1111`).
- **Blends:** angles take the short way round; fog distance blends in 1/distance; switches flip at the
  midpoint.
- **Variation.** Cover, wind speed and wind direction wander on a 300 s noise (`driftNoise1D`), with
  per-preset speed and intensity in the fork's `docs/integrators/weather-presets.md`.
- **Cover changes do not re-bake the clouds.** The cloud SDF's bake key holds no cover, and the
  thickness is quantised to 0.25 km (`CloudNvdfBakeKey`), so changing the cover often is cheap.

**GMod's scale.** A Remix metre is 100 units (`getMeterToWorldUnitScale`, `rtx.sceneScale 1`), and a
GMod unit is 1.905 cm, so a Remix metre is 1.905 real metres.

- **The map's size.** gm_construct's playable area is about 7,000 by 4,000 units, 70 by 40 Remix
  metres. The game's trace up from its field hits the sky ceiling at z 9,984. Its `light_environment`
  has pitch -56 and yaw 306: the sun is 56 degrees high at bearing 324.
- **The fog colour is sRGB.** `rtx.volumetrics.transmittanceColor` is gamma-encoded; the runtime
  turns it linear before it uses it (`rtx_global_volumetrics.h:144`, `getVolumeArgs` in the `.cpp`).
  0.92 is 0.83 linear, and for the presets' colours the extinction is 2.21-2.27 times what the raw
  value suggests.
- **The presets' fog**, made for kilometre-wide worlds, does not show inside a map. "Foggy" (0.92 over
  80 m) keeps about 85 % of the light across gm_construct.
- **Dense froxel fog turns black.** The froxel fog (`rtx.volumetrics`) is lit by lights only, not by
  the sky. Set from a visibility of 80 real metres, the ground and walls went black under a white sky;
  at 260 m everything was dark and murky; from 660 m up it reads as mist. (The first sessions worked
  the distance out from the raw colour and so took these for 180 m, 600 m and 1.5 km; the companion
  now uses the linear colour, with visibilities 2.27 times smaller for the same fog.)
- **The atmosphere's haze does not help.** Its aerial perspective starts at the froxel range
  (`froxelMaxDistanceMeters`, 20) and fades in over 50-250 m. Raising the aerosol density to 100-400
  barely touched the map; at 1,500 the whole scene went black. Widening the froxel range to 80 m only
  hands the whole map to the unlit froxel fog.

**Rain and snow** (`rtx_precipitation.*`, `particle_system_spawn.comp.slang`):

- **No drop was ever born with the runtime's cover test.** With `occludeUnderCover` (the default), the
  shelter probe traces up to `100000 * sceneScale` units (line 286), and above gm_construct it found
  cover everywhere.
  - The 3D skybox room hangs over the map: its miniature shows overhead in the path-traced sky, drawn
    because RTX sessions set `r_novis 1`.
  - The ray hits geometry the camera does not see, such as the room's floor from below.
- **With the test off, rain and snow fall.** The default volume, 20 Remix metres around the camera and
  14 above, is 2,000 and 1,400 units, so few drops land near the player. At 8 and 6 they are dense.
- **Against a bright sky** both rain streaks and flakes read darker than the sky, as real ones do.

**The cloud shadows.** With `cloudVoxelShadowsEnable True` (the runtime's default), cumulus shadows
drift over gm_construct's field, with sharp sunlit patches.

**What it costs** (2026-10-29, `out\sky\sessions\e8-final`, RTX 5090, 1280x720, the PoC's
settings with DLSS frame generation, machine otherwise idle). Rendered frames over 20 s at the field
camera, timed by a `PostRender` hook; the game's own counter showed about three times as many, the
generated frames included:

| Sky | fps | median | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Physical, partly cloudy | 148.3 | 6.74 ms | 8.74 ms |
| Physical, thunderstorm (rain, lightning) | 148.7 | 6.74 ms | 8.66 ms |
| The map's skybox | 150.5 | 6.65 ms | 8.39 ms |
| Physical again, partly cloudy | 147.7 | 6.78 ms | 8.90 ms |

So the physical sky costs about 0.1 ms a frame here (1.5 %), and rain costs nothing measurable. The
rate may sit near the frame-generation pacing, which could hide some of the cost; a slower GPU pays
more for the clouds, which are marched at full resolution.

## 29. The real Moon and night sky, eclipses and fog presets (2026-10-29, Claude)

**The Moon's source.** Downloaded 2026-10-29, with the user's go-ahead, into
`out\downloads\nasa-svs`, from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio: the CGI Moon Kit
(https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4720). Credit line: "NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio".

| File | Bytes | SHA-256 | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lroc_color_poles_4k.tif` | 13,095,388 | `918649a7...` | RGB 8-bit, 4096x2048, LZW |
| `ldem_4.tif` | 4,153,352 | `330afa25...` | 32-bit float, 1440x720 (4 pixels a degree), km above 1737.4 km: -8.88 to +10.50 |

- Simple cylindrical, north up, longitude 0 at the centre and east to the right (Mare Crisium at
  +59, Tycho at the bottom).
- Colour, linear luminance: 0.30 over the whole sphere, 0.2245 over the near side weighted towards
  the sub-Earth point (the maria make it darker). Per channel 0.340, 0.330, 0.297, a warm grey.
  99.9th percentile 0.80.
- Relief: slopes at 7.58 km a pixel, p50 0.046, p90 0.16, p99 0.30.

**The night sky's first source, rejected.** NASA's Deep Star Maps 2020 (https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4851,
Gaia DR2; `starmap_2020_8k.exr`, half-float, 8192x4096, J2000, RA 0h at the centre, increasing to the
left). Its luminance: p50 0.0016, p99 0.035, p99.99 1.0, mean 0.0046. At 8192 pixels round the sky
a star is a blob several pixels wide once magnified, and the mip choice streaked the poles; the user
rejected it as "very blurry and unsharp". PIL has no EXR reader; `out\sky\exr_read.py` decoded it.

**The night sky's source: Night Sky HD LE** (Skyrim, PraedythXVI,
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/107102), the 8K archive the user supplied,
`NightSky 8K HD LE-107102-1-0-1616679732.7z`: 316,655,566 bytes, SHA-256 `936eb7a3...`, extracted to
`out\downloads\nightsky8k` (a FOMOD: `00Data\Meshes\Sky\stars.nif`, `00Data\tex\<option>\...`).

- **Permissions** (the mod page, read in the built-in browser; WebFetch gets 403): converting it for

  FullNebula textures are PraedythXVI's edit of nebula images by Era-7 on Cubebrush, free, open assets;
  the user has permission to use them (2026-10-29).
- **What is in it.** Every texture is BC3 (DXT5) with 14 mips, gamma-space colour and alpha:

| Texture | Size | Bytes | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `StarsThornShape7\...\skystars.dds` (used; also `Stars5-7`, `StarsThornShape5-6`) | 8192x8192 | 89,478,640 | small sharp stars, two hemispheres tiled |
| `Textures\Sky\skyrimgalaxy.dds` | 8192x4096 | 44,739,408 | the galaxy band |
| `FullNebula1\...\FullNebula.dds` (used; also 2-4) | 8192x8192 | 89,478,640 | a nebula sphere in longitude and latitude |
| `Textures\Sky\skyrimconstellations.dds` | 8192x8192 | 89,478,640 | an atlas of constellation figures |

- **The mod's sky mesh** (`stars.nif`, 79,280 bytes, SHA-256 `c09afd2a...`; read with
  `out\sky\nif_read.py`: Skyrim LE, NIF 20.2.0.7, user version 12, BS version 83, whose geometry
  data holds a 4-byte material CRC after the vector flags). Four shapes, all `BSSkyShaderProperty`
  type 5, blended additively (colour times alpha) over the sky:
  - **Stars**: a sphere whose two hemispheres share one UV layout; antipodal points get the same
    UV. Centre `c = (0, -0.390731, 0.920505)`, theta-0 axis `(1, 0, 0)`, theta-90 axis
    `(0, -0.920505, -0.390731)`. The UV radius at 0, 10, ... 90 degrees from `c`: 0, 0.21128,
    0.41641, 0.60876, 0.7983, 1.01726, 1.24191, 1.46891, 1.70335, 1.95472 (interpolated between
    rings); `uv = (1 + r cos theta, r sin theta)`, tiled. Worst error over every vertex 0.0009.
  - **Galaxy band**: axis `n = (0.722456, -0.042907, 0.690085)`, along-axes
    `(-0.573207, 0.520957, 0.632486)` and `(-0.386642, -0.852504, 0.351773)`;
    `u = 2 + along x 3 / 2 pi`, `v = 0.5 - 0.5 sin(beta) / sin(40 degrees)`, half-width 40 degrees.
    Exact.
  - **Nebula**: `u = 0.5 + lon / 2 pi`, `v = 0.5 - lat / pi`. Exact.
  - **Constellations**: 58 triangles of their own atlas, about 110 atlas texels a degree.
  - Constants and checks: `out\sky\nightsky_mapping.py`. The shader treats the mesh's frame as
    equatorial (x RA 0h, y RA 6h, z the north celestial pole).

**The textures** (`out\sky\make_sky_textures.py`, `out\sky\bake_nightsky.py`; NVIDIA Texture Tools
Exporter 2023.4.0, the one in the RTX Remix app, at `-q production`):

| File | DXGI format | Size | Mips | Bytes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `moon_albedo.dds` | BC7_UNORM_SRGB (99) | 2048x1024 | 12 | 2,796,388 |
| `moon_normal.dds` | BC5_UNORM (83) | 1440x720 | 11 | 1,383,524 |
| `stars.dds` | BC3 (the mod's `skystars.dds`, unchanged) | 8192x8192 | 14 | 89,478,640 |
| `galaxy.dds` | BC3 (the mod's `skyrimgalaxy.dds`, unchanged) | 8192x4096 | 14 | 44,739,408 |
| `nebula.dds` | BC7_UNORM (98), box mips without gamma | 8192x8192 | 14 | 89,478,660 |

- **Moon albedo:** resized in linear light (Lanczos) and scaled by 1.114 to a near-side mean of 0.25
  (0.016 % of the pixels clip). The shader divides by 0.25 and multiplies by `moonTextureAlbedo`
  (0.12).
- **Moon relief:** central differences, east corrected by the cosine of the latitude, wrapped in
  longitude; mips without gamma.
- **Nebula:** `FullNebula.dds` colour times alpha, with the constellations rasterised into it from
  their triangles (ray through the planar triangle, barycentric UV, the atlas pre-filtered 2x2,
  added in gamma space as Skyrim adds them). The stars and the galaxy stay the mod's own files, so
  nothing resamples their stars.

**The runtime fork** (branch `claude/sky-night` in the worktree `remix-i18n`, from `2129d75f`):

- **Bindings.** 216 night sky galaxy (a retired slot: no pass binds it), 217 Moon albedo, 218 Moon
  relief, 219 night sky stars, 221 night sky nebula. 220 is `INTEGRATE_INSTRUMENTATION`, which is
  not in the common set; the sparse-rendering passes use 240-251. `BINDING_ATMOSPHERE_MAX` is now
  221. All five are sampled with `AtmosphereSkyViewSampler` (repeat in u, clamp in v; the stars'
  tiling uses `frac(uv)`).
- **`AtmosphereArgs`** takes the former `padAerial7/8` and grows by three 16-byte rows. All the new
  fields are zeroed in `normalizeForSkyLutCache`, so they never re-bake the sky tables. What the
  bakes must see of an eclipse is folded into `sunIlluminance` and `moons[0].color`.
- **Loading.** `AssetDataManager::findAsset` reads the DDS (gli or the partial DDS loader). Each mip
  goes up with `DxvkContext::updateImage`, whose pitches are bytes per row of 4x4 blocks. It happens
  at the first physical-sky frame for what is switched on, and again only when a path option
  changes. A 1x1 stand-in is bound until then. The three night sky layers take 223.7 MB of GPU
  memory, the Moon 4.2 MB.
- **The night sky's composite:** the three layers' colour times alpha added in gamma space, clamped
  at 1, then `pow 2.2` and `starMapBrightness`. Mips without derivatives: a traced pixel is
  `2 tan(fovY / 2) / downscaled height` radians (`skyPixelAngle`), times `2^mipBias` with the
  materials' total mip bias (DLSS: `log2(render / output width)`, -1 at Performance), against each
  layer's texels per radian there.
- **The night sky's brightness, against the mod's own screenshots** (the FOMOD's `Screenshots\1.png`
  and `2.png`, 3840x2160, `FullNebula1.png`, 1920x1080; gamma-space percentiles of the frame,
  `out\sky\shot_stats.py`): `1.png` p50 0.039, p90 0.35, p99 0.89; `FullNebula1.png` p50 0.007,
  p90 0.064, p99 0.47. Black space, bright nebulae, the galaxy core near white with its dust lanes.
  - In the PoC at night (1280x720, DLSS Performance, the classic tone mapping) auto exposure sits at
    its limit (`rtx.autoExposure.evMinValue -3.45`), so the image's brightness shows one to one: the
    same background with the image and with the procedural stars.
  - `starMapBrightness` 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.25: p99 of the view up 0.49, 0.62, 0.76, 0.88 (session
    `b11`). 0.12 matches the mod's nebulae.
  - The weather's airglow held space at 0.176 whatever the image did (clear: `nightSkyBrightness`
    0.008). At 100, 15, 10 and 5 % of it: p50 of the view up 0.176, 0.064, 0.052, 0.039; the ground
    in the field 0.061, 0.037, 0.035, 0.033 (session `b12`). Below 15 % the image lights the ground
    more than the airglow does. The companion sends 5 %.
  - Few stars show at 720p: each output pixel averages the star layer over its footprint (DLSS
    accumulates jittered samples), as Skyrim's mipmapped dome does. More show at 1440p and 4K.
- **The Moon's terminator.** A hard `cos i > 0` against the relief normal broke the shadow line into
  blocks at quarter and gibbous. It now follows the smooth sphere through a smoothstep about two
  pixels wide (`2 skyPixelAngle / radius` in `cos i`, clamped to 0.004-0.08), and the relief's
  `cos i` goes through a softplus.
- **Black pixels along the Moon's edge in a partial solar eclipse** (session `b11`, 8 degrees of
  view: 1 isolated black pixel at 50 %, 59 at 80 %, 6 at 93 %). They sat where a one-pixel step ran
  from the drawn disc, about 4e4 under the presets' sun (illuminance 20), to the dark Moon. The
  shader has no NaN there (the sky's final `max(radiance, 0)` would turn one into black, but every
  sqrt, division and pow on that path is guarded). With two-pixel edges and the disc capped at
  16384 the dots joined into a thin black arc along the Moon's limb, worse with Ray Reconstruction
  off (session `b14`: 22-174 a frame, and at 60 degrees of view too). Capped at 1024 the crescent
  read better but the pixels stayed (`b15`: 17-156).
  - **The upscaler makes them** (session `b16`, 88 % through Remix's debug views): the composite
    before the upscaler (`rtx.debugView.debugViewIdx 202`) is clean; the output before tone mapping
    (200) has the black pixels and some red ones; the NaN view (260) shows none. 154 of 156 are
    exactly (0, 0, 0).
  - Near totality the sky around the disc has dimmed to a few per cent, so a fixed cap still left
    the step from the dark Moon to the disc thousands of times the sky. The disc, chromosphere and
    corona are now held together to 64 times the daylight left (the brightest channel of the
    dimmed `sunIlluminance`), scaled as a whole so the hue stays. Session `b17`: no such pixel in
    any close-up from 0 to 100 %, with Ray Reconstruction on or off, 2 in one wide view; the partial
    sun now reads as a disc and a crescent instead of a glare, the corona and chromosphere as before.
- **Eclipse geometry with the companion's moon** (1.6 degrees across, radius 0.8): umbra 2.12
  degrees, penumbra 3.84, first penumbral contact at 4.64 degrees from the antisolar point; the
  companion's moon passes at 5.64 without an eclipse. The drawn sun is 0.776 degrees in radius; first
  contact at 1.576, totality inside 0.024.
- **The worktree's build never recompiles shaders by itself.** The shaders come from one ninja edge,
  `src/dxvk/_built_shaders.txt`, whose only input is `python.exe`, so ninja runs
  `compile_shaders.py` only while that stamp is missing. A shader or shader-header change needs
  `_CompRelease_x64\src\dxvk\_built_shaders.txt` deleted first; `compile_shaders.py` then rebuilds
  what changed (all of it if the outputs are gone: 2.5 min for 582 shaders on 32 threads; the whole
  build with a sky shader change, 2.7 min).
  - **What a missed rebuild does.** The first runtime-b6 paired the new C++, whose `RaytraceArgs`
    fields after `atmosphereArgs` had moved by 48 bytes, with the old shaders. The sky (read inside
    the atmosphere block) drew, every surface came out black, and the GPU hung within half a minute
    (`DLFG pacer: fence timed out`, `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`, Windows LiveKernelEvent 141; sessions
    `out\sky\sessions\b2`-`b4`).
  - Deleting the `rtx_shaders` outputs alone instead breaks the C++ build (their headers are gone).
  - **A shader-only change needs two builds.** The regenerated headers are not outputs ninja knows
    of, so the run that regenerates them has already judged the C++ up to date: the `.cpp` files
    that embed the shaders (`rtx_pathtracer_gbuffer.cpp`, `rtx_pathtracer_integrate_indirect.cpp`
    for the sky-miss path) recompile, and `d3d9.dll` relinks, only on the next run (0.6 min). A
    change that also touches a header those files include rebuilds them in the first run; one in
    `rtx_atmosphere.h` does not reach them. Sessions `b11`-`b13` ran with the C++ of that build and
    the shaders of the one before.
  - Sizes, measured with the compiler: `AtmosphereArgs` 1,232 bytes, `RaytraceArgs` 10,288, the
    atmosphere block at offset 6,832.
  - With the sky code the `d3d9.dll` grows from 345.8 MB to 362.7 MB: the sky-miss path is in every
    ray-tracing permutation.
- **Builds:** incremental, 0.2-1.1 min after a C++ change (`out\sky\build_runtime.ps1`).
- **Shader compile threads.** `dxvk.numCompilerThreads` sizes the state cache's workers, which
  compile Remix's own shaders (the "Compiling shaders (N remaining)" message, `dxvk_state_cache.cpp`).
  The classic install's `dxvk.conf` sets 1. DXVK's own default (0) is (threads - 1) x 5 / 7, capped at
  32: 22 here. The fork now reads -N as all threads but N; runtime-b6's second layer sets -2, and the
  log says `DXVK: Using 30 compiler threads` on the PoC's Ryzen 9 9950X3D (32 threads).
- **The Moon at 5 degrees of view** (about 15 times the usual zoom; the classic settings run DLSS
  Performance with Ray Reconstruction: `rtx.upscalerType 1`, `rtx.qualityDLSS 1`). The lit side
  along the terminator and the earthshine side break into diamond-shaped blocks 3-4 traced pixels
  across, the limb into steps. What changes them (sessions `b11`-`b14`):
  - Nothing of these: Ray Reconstruction off, DLAA (`rtx.qualityDLSS 5`), no clouds
    (`rtx.atmosphere.cloudEnabled False`), no volumetric fog (`rtx.volumetrics.enable False`, whose
    froxels are 4x4 traced pixels).
  - The relief: at 0 the terminator is a clean line, at 0.5 it has a few notches, at 1 a row of
    dark ones. The companion sets 0.6.
  - The texture is not it: `moon_albedo.dds` decodes sharp (Copernicus' rays at 2048x1024), and
    the full Moon, lit flat by Lommel-Seeliger, shows its craters cleanly at the same zoom.
  - At 20 degrees of view the Moon is clean.
  - Sky pixels give Ray Reconstruction a black albedo guide (alpha 0, `gbuffer_guides_output.slangh`),
    and its evaluation passes no bias-current-colour mask (`rtx_ngx_wrapper.cpp`). It was the first
    suspect, but turning it off changed nothing.
- **Two failures on the way that were not the sky's.**
  - A start-up "hang" right after Remix parsed its user settings (sessions `b7` and `b13b`, each the
    first start after a crash). It is Remix's crash-report prompt: the game's only window is
    "RTX Remix Crash Report", a modal `MessageBoxW` asking to upload the last crash
    (`showCrashReportDialogIfNeeded`, `src/util/util_sentry.cpp`). The prompt clears Sentry's
    crashed-last-run flag before it asks, so a session ended during it (the run's timeout) starts
    normally the next time, uploading nothing. `RTX_AUTOMATION_DISABLE_BLOCKING_DIALOG_BOXES=1`
    is no way round it: it also gives Sentry upload consent.
  - An access violation in `studiorender.dll` (a null read on the material system's render thread,
    at `studiorender.dll+0x5d353` every time) 7 s into a map, just after the RTX fixes forced a
    model reload: sessions `b6`, `b13` and `b16`, 3 of the 17 sky sessions, two of them on a runtime
    that had already run cleanly. No Remix code was on the stack. In `b16` the RTX fixes' own hook
    logged it first: `[HWSkin] CRASH in DrawGroupHWSkin trampoline!`, then
    `[HWSkin] Exception in RenderFinal trampoline (occurrence #1)`.

**runtime-b6** (`out\sky\make_runtime_b6.ps1`): runtime-b4's extract with the sky fork's `d3d9.dll`
and `atmosphere\` (the five textures and `CREDITS.txt`), the same dxvk layer, environment and launch
arguments as runtime-b5, and the compiler-threads layer. 197 files and the manifest, 1,229,297,958
bytes, version `0.0.0-dev.202610292335+a2e1708e`; the `.gma` 1,229,349,449. `d3d9.dll` 362,684,416
bytes, SHA-256 `a2e1708e...`. The combined RTX package built from it (`out\sky\build_e2e.py`): 877
files, 1,798,369,314 bytes.

## 30. One repository: the package's inputs in Git LFS (2026-10-30, Claude)

**Where the package came from before** (`tools/workshop.json` at `bbab69e`): ten parts from six places
outside this repository. Measured with `out\sky\inventory_inputs.py` (git metadata, `_Comp*` build
folders and `external\` left out):

| Source | Files | Size | Origin |
|---|---|---|---|
| runtime-b6's tree (`out\sky\runtime-b6-src\runtime`, the runtime-b4 extract plus the sky textures) | 189 | 977 MB | built; `d3d9.dll` 339 MB, `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` 266 MB, `nvrtc64_130_0.dll` 101 MB |
| the fixes repository (`garrys-mod-rtx-remixed`) | 64,565 | 83.7 GB | `SheepyLord/garrys-mod-rtx-remixed`; its `source\` map extracts and work trees |
| the classic install's `garrysmod\lua\bin` | 21 | 35 MB | built modules |
| Model Hotloader (the classic install's add-on; its repository) | 104; 27,381 | 61 MB; 2.9 GB | `SheepyLord/Gmod-Model-Hotloader-with-Vulkan` |
| the material editor | 1,910 | 3.9 GB | `SheepyLord/-advanced_material_editor` (work trees) |
| the bullet-break simulator | 16,721 | 3.7 GB | `SheepyLord/-gmod_bullet_break_simulator` (a 961 MB theater build, artifacts) |
| the motion importer | 275 | 362 MB | `SheepyLord/Gmod-Mmd-Motion-Importer` |
| the runtime fork's worktree | 19,047 | 3.6 GB | `sambow23/dxvk-remix-gmod`, NVIDIA's SDK submodules (`nvngx_dlssd.dll` twice, `nvrtc`) |

**What the parts actually use** (each packager's `<out>.inventory.txt`, the `source` column), imported
by `out\sky\migrate_parts.py` into `packages\`:

| Part | Files | Size | Stored |
|---|---|---|---|
| runtime | 197 | 1,229.4 MB | 412.4 MB |
| fixes | 444 | 449.7 MB | 116.5 MB |
| model-hotloader | 111 | 87.0 MB | 68.2 MB |
| character-motion-importer | 17 | 19.3 MB | 9.1 MB |
| reshade | 1 | 4.1 MB | 4.0 MB |
| emissives | 1 | 3.8 MB | 0.1 MB |
| advanced-material-editor | 59 | 2.7 MB | 2.5 MB |
| procedural-bodygroup-destruction | 16 | 0.8 MB | 0.8 MB |
| advanced-bodygroup-tool | 6 | 0.2 MB | 0.2 MB |
| remove-halo | 1 | 27 bytes | 27 bytes |

853 files, 1.8 GB, stored in 614 MB (588 MB on disk). The packagers read two files they do not list:
the fixes' `garrysmod\garrysmod\cfg\autoexec.cfg` (session variables) and, for `--addon-file`, the
add-on's own file it replaces (Model Hotloader's `installation.lua`: "the add-on has no such file to
replace" otherwise).

- **LZMA (xz, preset 6) on the first 64 MB:** `d3d9.dll` 0.17 (5.0 MB/s), `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` 0.70,
  `nvrtc64_130_0.dll` 0.30, `stars.dds` 0.05 (mostly black). Decompression runs far faster.
- **Parity.** `tools/build_package.py --compare out\workshop\published.json` from the imported parts:
  877 files, a 1,798,746,608-byte archive, content digest `942d0083...`, equal to the upload of
  `bbab69e` (version `0.0.0-dev.20261030000530+f6c615a6`). The digest leaves out versions, but the
  part versions came out the same too: `unpack` restores each file's recorded time, and the packagers
  stamp versions from the newest input's time.
- **The runtime rebuild is deterministic.** `runtime/build_runtime.ps1` on the fork worktree
  `remix-i18n` (the base plus the four patches) built a `d3d9.dll` with the packaged SHA-256
  (`d9cf79e6...`).
- **Git LFS on GitHub** (docs.github.com, billing for Git LFS, read 2026-10-30): GitHub Free and Pro
  include 10 GiB of storage and 10 GiB of bandwidth a month; Actions downloads count against the
  owner's bandwidth; over the bandwidth (no payment method) LFS is disabled for the account until the
  next month; over the storage, pushes of new LFS files fail. The repository is private
  (`gh repo view`: `PRIVATE`).
- **`git lfs install` and this repository's hooks.** `post-commit`, `post-merge` and `pre-push` were
  already this project's (the Workshop publisher), so `git lfs install` would not have written its own.
  Without `git lfs pre-push`, a push sends pointer files whose content GitHub never receives. The
  publisher's hooks now run Git LFS's step first; `pre-push` reads git's ref lines once and gives them
  to both.
- **The runtime fork's patches:** `git format-patch --binary --no-signature --zero-commit
  c6b48ed1..claude/sky-night`: 0001 the snapshot 2,852,185 bytes, 0002 the translated menus
  11,434,313 (generated tables), 0003 the glossaries 70,971, 0004 the sky 63,303. The snapshot adds
  six lines to `.gitmodules`.

## 31. Review R3: what the runtime was really built from, and other facts (2026-10-29, Claude)

**The packaged `d3d9.dll` (`d9cf79e6...`, 362,791,936 bytes) was built from more than
`runtime/patches`.** `runtime/build_runtime.ps1 -Verify` against the worktree it was built in
(`<fork>\.claude\worktrees\remix-i18n`, `claude/sky-night` at `f9937026`):
- The worktree's commit tree is exactly `c6b48ed1` with the four patches (tree `815f0dca`).
- `submodules/nvapi` is checked out at `87dca62` ("R615-Developer SDK"), where `c6b48ed1` and the
  patched tree record `d08488f` (R570). The fork's own checkout (`gmod-1.6.1`) has R615 too.
- `submodules/rtxdi` (at its recorded `3b39a7c`) has three staged, uncommitted changes:
  `rtxdi-sdk/include/rtxdi/ResamplingFunctions.slangh` (100 lines), `Reservoir.slangh` (6) and
  `shaders/ResamplingCompileTest.comp.slang` (20); `git diff HEAD --binary --full-index` 10,604
  bytes, byte-identical in the fork's checkout. Patch 0001 (the snapshot) covered the superproject
  only. Now `runtime/submodules/rtxdi.patch`.
- `submodules/dlss` (`https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS.git`, `3749594`, "DLSS 310.9.1 SDK") and
  `submodules/sharc` (`https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Spatial-Hash-Radiance-Cache.git`, `4e21b58`,
  v1.8.3) are untracked git clones, in the fork's checkout as well: its tree records neither.
  `external-build/meson.build:151` sets `dlss_root_path = 'submodules/dlss'`.
- In the worktree, `include/MathLib/External/sse2neon/.git` (inside a submodule) points to no
  repository, so `git status --ignore-submodules=untracked` and `git submodule status` both stop
  with "gitfile does not point to a valid repository". The script reads each submodule's recorded
  commit from `git ls-tree -r HEAD` (mode 160000) and its own `HEAD` instead.

**RemixConfig.GetConfigVariable** (the RTX fixes' Lua binding,
`garrys-mod-rtx-remixed/source/remixapi/remixapi.cpp`, `ConfigManager::GetConfigVariable`): it parses
the rtx.conf it finds and returns that file's value, else `""` ("no default fallback"; the Remix API
cannot read options back). So a Lua add-on cannot read a live option; to put one back it needs
rtx.conf's value or the defaults itself. The fixes' `rtx_water` and `gm_poolrooms_rtx` restore from it
the same way.

**The runtime's defaults the weather touches** (`RTX_OPTION` fourth argument; 61 options, now in
`weather_presets.lua` `defaults`), for example `rtx.atmosphere.cloudDensity 4`,
`rtx.weather.precipitation.intensity 0`, `spawnRadiusMeters 20`, `spawnHeightMeters 14`,
`fallMarginMeters 8`, `occludeUnderCover True`. The package's classic layer sets nine of them
(`cloudCoverageMean 0.27`, `cloudCoverageSpread 0.8`, `cloudTypeMean 0.9`, `cloudShadowStrength 0`,
`volumetrics.anisotropy 0.55`, `singleScatteringAlbedo 0.98`, `transmittanceColor 0.975, 0.985, 0.995`,
`transmittanceMeasurementDistanceMeters 420`, among them). The fork's checkout and the build worktree
give the same table.

**The loader's in-memory patches after a GMod update** (for R3-001): each of the seven patterns
(`tools/package_fixes.py` `PATCH_SETS`) must occur exactly once in its module, or that patch is
skipped and reported, "the pattern does not occur (another build?)" or "the pattern occurs more than
once" (`loader/core/src/patch.cpp:69`). No game DLL is pinned by hash. The `stdshader_dx6.dll`
override (the fixes' build) is loaded in place of the game's whatever the game's build.

## 32. R3-016: limbs in bind pose on Modern House; the runtime's 259-character variables (2026-10-29, Claude)

**What the user saw** (field install, `modern_house` with Modern House RTX): a new HSR character's
ragdoll (`[577 | -1] prop_ragdoll`), the player and the view model drawn with limbs, clothes and hair
in bind pose around the pelvis. Model Hotloader's models and Hibiki
(`models/littlesdy/kancolle/desdiv6/hibiki/e_hibiki_npc.mdl`, `[566 | -1] npc_citizen`) were right.
Measured in that live session with the RTXDebug module and a probe in the runtime:

- **The trigger:** Modern House RTX's `modern_house_rtx.lua` set `r_forcehwlight 1` among its scoped
  settings, every PreRender on its map. `r_forcehwlight 0` in the same session put every model right at
  once; 1 broke them again.
- **The mechanism:** with it on, the RTX fixes' hook on `R_StudioSetupSkinAndLighting`
  (`prop_fixes.cpp`) forces hardware lighting on every model. With `r_forcehwskin 0`, a mesh Source can
  skin on the GPU (a DX90 `.vtx` and no `.sw.vtx`: the HSR characters, the player model, the hands) then
  goes through Source's fixed-function hardware skinning, which in this build sets neither
  `D3DRS_VERTEXBLEND` nor `D3DRS_INDEXEDVERTEXBLENDENABLE` nor any `WORLDMATRIX(1+)`. The probe
  (`processSkinning` in `src/d3d9/d3d9_rtx.cpp`, logging each draw; removed afterwards) logged
  `vb=0 ivb=0 maxBoneSeen=0` for every such draw. The runtime reads vertex blend off as "not skinned"
  and draws the mesh rigid with `WORLDMATRIX(0)`, the first bone: the pelvis.
- **Why some models were right:** Model Hotloader skins its models on the CPU itself, and Hibiki's
  model has a `.sw.vtx`, so Source skins it on the CPU.
- **`mat_softwareskin` does not hold:** it is `FCVAR_CHEAT` (flags 16384, `Engine.GetConVar`). The
  loader's `nativeloader_session.cfg` and the fixes' `autoexec.cfg` set it to 1, and with 1 every model
  draws right even with `r_forcehwlight 1`; but Source puts cheat variables back to their defaults when
  `sv_cheats` goes from 1 to 0, and its default is 0 (seen in the session: 1, then `sv_cheats 1` and
  `0`, then 0).
- **The classic install never ran with `r_forcehwlight 1`:** its launch line has
  `+r_forcehwlight 1`, but the variable is created later by `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary`, so the launch
  option finds nothing to set and is dropped.
- **The fix:** Modern House RTX no longer sets it (`garrys-mod-rtx-remixed`, branch
  `claude/modern-house-rtx`, `e96ad7f`); item 3829275998 updated to `0.0.0-dev.202610300425+d7efd636`
  (`gma_sha256 d90c206b...`). In the field install with it: `r_forcehwlight` 0 (flags 0, default 0,
  "Force LIGHTING_HARDWARE") and `mat_softwareskin` 1 on `modern_house`, and the user saw the models
  right.

**`DXVK_CONFIG_FILE` (and every variable the runtime reads) holds at most 259 characters (R3-017).**
`env::getEnvVar` (`src/util/util_env.cpp:47-54` in the fork) reads it with `GetEnvironmentVariableW`
into a `MAX_PATH` buffer. A longer value does not fit, nothing is copied, and the variable reads as
empty; `RtxOptionLayer::resolveConfigPaths` (`src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_option_layer.cpp:617-627`) then
falls back to `dxvk.conf` alone. Every package layer is dropped without a message. A probe package
with a longer version reached 261 characters and started with a black screen; with a shorter version
(235) it rendered. The loader's paths are relative to the game folder, so the Steam library's path does
not count; the package's id, version and generation do, twice, and every added layer:

| `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE` of the published package (`0.0.0-dev.20261030022927+8beef27e`) | Characters |
|---|---|
| NVIDIA GPU, generation 9 / 21 / 999 | 237 / 239 / 241 |
| No NVIDIA GPU (`native-loader/remix/non-nvidia.conf` added, ADR 0030), the same | 273 / 275 / 277 |

So without an NVIDIA GPU, an RTX session of the published package ran without its layers. The limit
itself was known (section 19, and ADR 0021 noted a long list); the package's longer versions and the
non-NVIDIA layer (ADR 0030) crossed it, and only on GPUs this machine does not test with. Fixed by
listing short copies of the layers instead (ADR 0036): 73 characters for the published package, 109
without an NVIDIA GPU.

**The runtime build is reproducible but for its stamps.** Built again in the same verified worktree
(`build_runtime.ps1 -Verify` passes), `d3d9.dll` has the same size (362,791,936 bytes) and differs from
the packaged one (`d9cf79e6...`, now `d899908e...`) in 15 bytes: the PE time stamp and checksum in the
header, the time stamp's three copies in the debug directory, and one byte of the CodeView record
(`0x1f` against `0x23`, the PDB age).

## 33. Frame generation and the GPU (2026-10-29, Claude, from the user's report)

- **The classic defaults turned DLSS-G on at 3x:** `packages/runtime/layers/classic_remix_defaults.conf`
  had `rtx.frameGenerationType = 1`, `rtx.dlfg.enable = True` and `rtx.dlfg.maxInterpolatedFrames = 2`
  (two generated frames per rendered one), from the classic install's files on an RTX 5090. The
  runtime's own defaults: `rtx.frameGenerationType` 0, `rtx.dlfg.maxInterpolatedFrames` 2 (range 1-6;
  `runtime/patches/0001`, the options table).
- **The user's report:** with it, players on RTX 30, RTX 40 and AMD GPUs crashed at start. DLSS-G needs
  RTX 40 or newer; more than one generated frame needs RTX 50.
- **Remix's menu shows the multiplier only where multi-frame generation is supported**
  (`if (supportsMultiFrame) { dlfgMfgModeCombo... }`, `runtime/patches/0001`, line 8518 of the patch),
  so on RTX 40 the inherited 3x could not be lowered there.
- Fixed in the package's layer and in `tools/remix_defaults.py` ([ADR 0037](decisions/0037-frame-generation-off-by-default.md)):
  off by default, one generated frame when turned on.

## 34. Translation coverage audit (2026-10-30)

- The original companion checker accepted missing, empty and fuzzy entries, so its success did not
  establish completeness. The release builder now rejects them; draft fallback is explicit.
- Runtime extraction found 3,293 existing messages and no missing source keys. Its template had
  stale references. Translating the initial weather state adds one: 3,294 messages per language.
  The weather status formatted raw preset names through `%s`; translating the outer format alone
  could not translate those values (`rtx_weather.cpp`, `showImguiSettings`).
- Native add-on coverage after this pass: Bodygroup Tool 104, Destruction 204, Material Editor 1,141,
  material help 83, Motion Importer 364 and Model Hotloader 2,030 English keys. All six translations
  have matching keys; Motion also retains complete Arabic and Spanish catalogs.
- Material Editor's reverse lookup deliberately refuses ambiguous strings. Different Japanese words
  for the same generic Colour/Strength labels, and inconsistent Texture path wording, caused English
  fallback across every locale. Those terms now agree; Edit buttons carry an explicit context key.
- The six apparent missing Destruction entries were autonyms and a model-path example, not missing
  prose. They are explicit invariants now. Korean was absent, and four add-ons mapped Traditional
  Chinese to Simplified Chinese; both gaps are corrected.
- Runtime setup under this repository exposed delayed expansion consuming `!` in `update-deps.cmd`.
  Quoted paths and disabled delayed expansion fix it. Windows PowerShell 5.1 and Python 3.12 were used
  for the verified runtime rebuild. The fresh runtime tree also needed seven unit/app test sources
  omitted by the snapshot's ignore rules, read from the existing verified tree to finish Meson
  setup; these do not enter the runtime DLL. R6's review below distinguishes staged additions from
  untracked local copies.

Evidence is under `out/translation-audit`; final commands and PoC results are in the
[QoL report](handover/QoL-report.md).

The final UI tour inspected 6,850 text elements across English and the six requested languages, with no builder or Lua errors and a normal exit. Six matches for `Hair` were stored bodygroup identifiers (`cl_20_filters.lua:7`, displayed verbatim by `cl_90_settings.lua:307`), not missing UI translations. Runtime logging exposed concatenated migration buttons in `dxvk_imgui.cpp`; patch 0006 replaces them with static translated labels and formatted count lines. The runtime now has 3,298 messages per language. The user explicitly accepts resizing the Remix settings window to reveal long labels.

## Native package cards and Steam publisher preflight (2026-10-30)

- Stock `html/js/menu/control.Addons.js:488` adds `invalid` for `invalid_reason`; lines 498-504 return
  that reason before `file.info.description`. `html/css/Workshop.css:484` colors invalid cards red.
  `lua/includes/util/workshop_files.lua:254-291` already obtains and sanitizes the real Workshop
  description. The generated overlay restores that existing description flow for managed IDs.
- PoC `filesystem_stdio.dll` SHA-256 `814373ea10b7e4e4f48c1eaf820f35e7fed2a5ef756e77f0fb2d68d1323ce1ad`
  imports A/W CreateFile and attribute APIs directly; its CRT is linked statically. REA Ghidra
  evidence `ev_233af55c3f1d0ff2eedebf94964447b1db4bdd18a228cdac909aca0d98dc8ed0` identifies the whitelist
  failure in the filename validator. This was static evidence; the PoC then demonstrated actual
  archive and menu-script redirection through those four IAT slots.
- PoC acceptance mounted **761/761** subscriptions. Four current native packages (RTX runtime,
  Modern House, Guinaifen and Robin) used inert display GMAs; no `native/manifest.json` whitelist
  warning or native-package mount warning remained. All four cards were blue; the runtime's
  normal Workshop description was visible. The game quit normally with exit 0.
- The reviewed `gmpublish.exe` (SHA-256 in `tools/publish_workshop.py`) calls
  `SteamAPI_IsSteamRunning` at VA `0x14000818d`, before real initialization. On this machine it
  returned false while `SteamAPI_InitFlat` and the exact required interface-list initialization
  returned success. Steam's ActiveProcess PID was stale. The guarded isolated-copy fallback changes
  only file byte `0x7595`, `75` to `eb`; the same target continues to the original real init.
  REA evidence `ev_011fc45734d0cb8f00bf67919e04784c234ed717c5d3b32594959e610fb15a06`.
- Evidence: task worktree `out/native-addon-menu`; screenshots, own-session console, loader reports,
  REA snapshots and restoration records. PoC config files were restored by hash; its own video
  changes (ScreenWidth, ScreenHeight, DXLevel_V1) were restored only while they still matched the
  test's recorded values. No user's running game was operated.

## Modern House native glass (2026-10-30)

- The installed map 3495468649 has 52 func_breakable entities and no func_breakable_surf. Its BSP
  entity/model lumps were read without extracting or editing the map. At runtime, 44 have a valid
  convex VPhysics mesh whose material is glass; other entries are metal, shadow or have no physics.
- Existing Glass-Rewrite-Remix `procedural_shard.lua` only handled func_breakable_surf. The real
  baseline pane (*9) had health 15 and 36 physics vertices; bullet damage removed it with no shards.
  The observed hook order was EntityTakeDamage, EntityRemoved, break_breakable, then damage return.
  EntityRemoved alone cannot be treated as a break and cannot immediately discard the cached mesh.
- The engine event is documented by [Facepunch](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gameevent/break_breakable).
  Physical convex triangles come from [PhysObj:GetMeshConvexes](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj:GetMeshConvexes).
  The addon now preserves native brush logic and uses the event for debris only.
- The first fixed probe had 18/18 valid physics shards, 18/18 client meshes and 18 pieces still on
  the floor after 30 seconds. The complete-package RTX run confirmed real reflected glass geometry,
  native OnBreak output, scripted horizontal panes, 256/256 full-resync meshes, cleanup to zero
  and 18 new pieces after rebreaking. Evidence is in the map-glass worktree under out/glass-map.
- Runtime util_filesys.h maps DXVK_LOG_PATH to the Logs directory, which also owns the Sentry
  database. util_sentry.cpp checks crashed-last-run before engine condebug exists. A fresh test-only
  log directory avoids an old report prompt without touching its files or consent. Ray tracing was
  True in the isolated run's Remix log; the game loaded and quit normally with zero Lua errors.

## Hotloader's DepthWrite on Remix (2026-10-30)

- Bundled `mmd_hotloader/lua/mmdhl/native_render.lua` created DepthWrite clones during the first
  color registration, before it knew whether that shader family was present. The existing
  UsesRemixPreview query only read RenderStats, whose native flag starts unresolved.
- Native renderer.cpp initialize selects stdshader_dx9.dll when loaded, otherwise the fixed-function
  stdshader_dx6.dll, and records fixedFunctionRemix. CheckRenderer performs that initialization;
  RenderStats alone does not. The Lua predicate now calls the available CheckRenderer first.
- The reported asset (hash beginning f9c3e4b4) is already in the PoC cache and has 83 slots. A real
  baseline run recorded 83 MMD depth-material requests and 131 unknown DepthWrite console lines
  (83 Hotloader materials and 48 separate built-in engine messages).
  The model's color draws still ran; a console filter would leave the bad material registrations.
- [DepthWrite's documented role](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Shaders/DepthWrite) includes hardware
  depth and alpha cutouts. The programmable Source path remains unchanged. Remix's ordinary scene
  geometry supplies its ray tracing, so its unsupported Source-only depth draws are skipped.
- Only bundled Lua and its indexed provenance change. The upstream Hotloader checkout, native
  release record, cached asset bytes and carrier identities are not edited by this batch.

## Remix settings persistence (2026-10-30)

- `nativeloader_menu.lua:100` formerly created archived numeric ConVars with empty defaults and bound
  them directly to DNumSlider. PoC client.vdf independently contained max_bounces=0, sky_brightness=0
  and colour_purity=0 while dropdown values remained empty. Source's numeric controls coerce empty
  to zero. The fix uses unbound widgets, guarded initialization and explicit numeric selections;
  startup replay is off by default (current menu lines 100–157 and 215–246).
- The fixes' `source/remixapi/remixapi.cpp:1111` GetConfigVariable reads only a discovered rtx.conf
  and returns empty if the key is absent. It does not read the live runtime or user.conf. The panel
  must not treat it as a synchronized runtime getter. The new controls never use it for sync.
- `rtx_fork_tonemap.h:99` defines Psycho17 purityScale=1.0; its native UI permits 0–5. Zero is a valid
  authored choice, so globally replacing zero or changing user.conf during deployment is incorrect.
- Runtime `src/util/config/config.cpp:1474` previously opened the destination with truncation and
  silently returned on open failure. `RtxOptionLayer::save` changed its baseline before this write
  and then always marked itself saved. Patch 0008 stages with CREATE_NEW, checks writes, flushes and
  closes, and uses MoveFileExW with REPLACE_EXISTING/WRITE_THROUGH. The saved baseline advances only
  after success. Reload reads completely before removing active layer values.
- The rebuilt runtime is 362,799,104 bytes, SHA-256
  `ab03a3f792b1f75fcbb63270ba327e836af29cdd691d2a5b9d01db0052dd296b`, from verified
  eight-patch tree `615096202d12baa268afdac94e13eb8682094fe0`. No shader source changed.

## Welcome policy and animated toolgun screen (2026-10-30)

- The old welcome dialog's missing-value defaults were true. Closing it persisted those values,
  so an old true alone cannot demonstrate explicit consent. The new policy marker and SDK archive
  are evaluated before sentry_init; new/legacy grants fail closed. The NoSave showUI option must
  use its derived layer even through the public API. Exposing FirstUseGuide as BASIC to the public
  getUiState also releases GMod's cursor through the existing tmc bridge.
- Disposable-profile GPU acceptance kept both grants false, cancelled the countdown by clicking
  the title, saved neverShowFirstUseGuide=true and retained dismissal in a new process. The
  unattended opening logged dismissal after approximately twelve visible seconds.
- Dynamic Toolgun Screen item 3826729485 retains the stock
  models/weapons/v_toolgun/screen material while updating its render-target texture. The stock
  mesh has two triangles, weighted to bone 41. Its mesh rest matrix is already inverse bind;
  multiplying the current bone matrix by that matrix reproduces the live pose.
- GMod's render.GetViewSetup(true) supplies the actual viewmodel FOV and near/far planes; using
  the world FOV misaligns a redraw. Source texture flag globals are not exposed in this client,
  so the render-target clamp flags use their numeric value 12. Allocation failure must not clear
  the main framebuffer.
- Live native/DLSS/DLSS-G comparisons on the isolated fixture preserved the moving text and screen
  alignment. The final DLSS-G stages resolved frameGenerationType=1 and dlfg.enable=True, with
  fsrfg.enable=False; capture/draw counts advanced and no module error was logged.

## R4 companion review facts (2026-10-31)

From the RTX fixes' source (`H:\BACKUP_20260815\Modding\garrys-mod-rtx-remixed\source`, read only)
and this repository:

- `RemixMaterial.GetMaterialHashRevision()` returns nil whenever the native material-hash lookup is
  unavailable: while a refresh runs, or after one failed (`d3d9_texture_tracker.cpp:794-801`). A
  refresh fails when any cached texture has no hash yet (`:748-752`, `:780-784`) and runs at most
  once a second (`:716-737`), so nil is common while textures load; the old outline module then
  rescanned every cached material and re-read every hash on every frame.
- `RemixMaterial.GetCachedMaterials()` lists the tracker's whole texture cache, every material drawn
  (world brushes, decals and sprites too: `d3d9_texture_tracker.cpp:472-480`); it says nothing about
  which entity uses a material.
- `RemixMaterial.GetAllTextureHashes(name)` reads only that cache (`material_lua_bindings.cpp:644-690`,
  `d3d9_texture_tracker.cpp:445-470`): a material has hashes only after it was drawn.
- `RemixConfig.SetConfigVariable` prints a warning on every refused write (`config_lua_bindings.cpp:27-30`);
  `RemixMaterial.TrackMaterial` warns for a name with no material or no `$basetexture`
  (`material_lua_bindings.cpp:547-553`).
- The runtime's `rtx.gmod.ignoreOutlineMeshes` defaults to `True` (NoSave; runtime patch 0014,
  `rtx_model_layers.h`), so the companion sends `False` to keep the shell rule off.
- `rtx_pseudoplayer` is created by the RTX fixes (`remixlua/cl/cl_rtx_misc.lua:3`, default 1), which
  `autorun/cl_rtx.lua` includes while GMod runs `lua/autorun/`, before `lua/autorun/client/`: the
  companion menu's own `CreateClientConVar("rtx_pseudoplayer", "0", ...)` never set the default.
- Glass Rewrite's client asks for every shard once (an empty `SHARD_NETWORK` 1 s after
  `InitPostEntity`, `networking.lua`) and for each new shard in its `Initialize`
  (`procedural_shard.lua:716-719`); 256 shards of 300 vertices are about 920 KB.

## Layered alpha cutouts and outline meshes (2026-10-30)

- Ordered GBuffer rays forced opaque hits and used resolveVertexFinalContinue's normal offset
  after alpha rejection. With coplanar MMD layers the offset could pass the valid face too.
  Ganyu's raw-albedo nose patch was blue back hair, establishing geometry selection before
  lighting as the remaining cause. In-traversal rejection removed it from the first captured
  cold spawn, with micromaps off and targeted facial workarounds disabled.
- rejectCutoutCandidate uses the existing material alpha evaluation and preserves the original
  comparison and texture operations. Ray queries commit accepted nonopaque candidates; matching
  any-hit stages mirror the existing closest-hit payload variants. SPIR-V entry-point validation
  checks 104 any-hit and 104 closest-hit outputs in both release and dedicated unit builds.
- Cached geometry flags were refreshed only for vertex/billboard changes; static skin/material
  opacity changes also need refresh. Dynamic BLAS compatibility must be checked even without a
  vertex update. Shared geometry is opaque only when all linked instances are opaque, while the
  no-duplicate-any-hit flag is retained if any linked instance needs it.
- Live metadata exposes two skins for models/pm/ganyu_kk_pm.mdl, and one for the cached Lynette
  and March 7th playermodels. Ganyu's hei is the dedicated black outline material; touming is its
  transparent partner. Eyebrow/eye-white names can carry parenthesized mayuge/sirome suffixes.
  These names are relevant only to optional outline suppression, not cutout correctness.
- A front-culled shell can be invisible to the camera while its inward faces block light from
  the model. Ignoring the incompatible shell removes that geometry from every rendering path.
  The owned outline texture list joins the existing Hidden category without replacing user data.
- Pure state synchronization must run from Think: the main opaque pass can have a non-nil render
  target. GPU hash readiness can change without a material-binding revision; unresolved hashes
  need retry and resolved bindings need periodic refresh. Ordinary-image aliases are protected.
- Separate fresh processes avoid retained-mesh ghosts when replacing actors at identical poses.
  All three supplied models were clear at the first, two-second and fourteen-second captures
  with micromaps disabled. GBuffer compute-query, raygen-query and trace-ray views were clear;
  skin changes, opt-out/re-enable and normal micromaps were exercised. RTXDebug Engine.GetConVar
  independently reported nativeloader_ignore_outlines=1 with archive flags.

## R4 field facts (2026-10-31, Claude)

Measured on the user's install (RTX 5090, loader 0.10.0 and the published package, the user's
`mat_queue_mode "2"`, 766 subscriptions); evidence in the main checkout's `out\qa-field\`.

- **Procedural glass and queued rendering.** Drawing a `procedural_shard` with `ENT:Draw` ->
  `self:DrawModel()` and `ENT:GetRenderMesh` returning a Lua `IMesh` crashed the game on the material
  system's render thread: access violation reading `0xffffffffffffffff` at `studiorender.dll+0x6603b`,
  called from `+0x141b9` <- `+0x5cb21` <- `+0x5fea7` <- `materialsystem.dll` queued context <- a
  `vstdlib.dll` job thread; no project module on that stack. It happened for map debris and for the
  add-on's own spawned pane alike, and not at all when the entity drew its mesh itself
  (`cam.PushModelMatrix(self:GetWorldTransformMatrix())` + `IMesh:Draw()`). Destroying meshes late alone
  did not stop it. Codex's PoC acceptance of the map glass ran with the default `mat_queue_mode`.
- **What Remix rasterizes into a render target.** In an RTX session, 2D draws into a render target from
  `HUDPaint` work as in Direct3D 9 (`render.Clear`, `render.ClearRenderTarget` and an opaque rectangle
  all clear it; moving text leaves no trail). The same 2D draws from `PostDrawOpaqueRenderables` leave
  the target black. A perspective draw (`cam.Start` with a 3D camera) is taken into the path-traced
  scene even inside `HUDPaint`. Dynamic Toolgun Screen's target (`DTScreen_Screen512`, drawn in
  `SWEP:RenderScreen`) is sharp when shown flat on the HUD; on the gun only the path-traced screen is
  seen, whose scrolling text smears under temporal reconstruction.
- **Crash-report prompts.** After a crash the runtime's next start shows "RTX Remix Crash Report"
  (Yes/No, in the Windows language: `はい(&Y)` / `いいえ(&N)` here), and after No may show a notice that
  pending reports could not be removed (OK). `WM_COMMAND` with `IDNO` (7), then `IDOK` (1), answers
  them in any language; the reports folder is emptied when it can be.
- **Field timings.** With 766 subscriptions the Workshop remount took 16.5 s and gm_construct was ready
  23-27 s after launch; the loader's start-up took 0.34-0.36 s.
- **GMod's menu reads generated JavaScript as Windows-1252.** A UTF-8 `·` written into the loader's
  copy of `control.Menu.js` showed as `Â·`, and every translated label as mojibake; `\uXXXX` escapes
  (ASCII only) show correctly in all seven languages (loader 0.10.1).
- **The RTX fixes' late model flush races queued rendering** (PoC, the same game binaries as the
  field, `-windowed 1280x720`, no Workshop mount). `cl_rtx.lua` calls
  `RTX_ReloadModelsAfterHardwareSkinningSettings` (`MDLCACHE_FLUSH_STUDIOHWDATA`) once at autorun and
  once one second after `InitPostEntity`, when the world is drawn. 4 of 8 starts crashed within a
  few seconds of that second flush: access violation reading 0 at `studiorender.dll+0x5d353` on a
  `vstdlib.dll` job thread running the `materialsystem.dll` queued context, `[HWSkin] CRASH in
  DrawGroupHWSkin trampoline!` or `[HWSkin] Exception in RenderFinal trampoline` logged during the
  flush. The fork's SEH guards around those hooks date from upstream (2026-08), so the race predates
  the QoL batch. The field (766 add-ons, 4K) reached the map 14 times without it. `RunConsoleCommand
  ("mat_queue_mode", "0")` from client Lua is accepted, and the material system leaves queued mode at
  a frame boundary after waiting for its thread.
- **Minidumps and the declined prompt.** The dump of a crash is written to
  `rtx-remix\logs\.sentry-native\reports\<uuid>.dmp`; once the next start's prompt is answered No,
  Remix deletes it, so a test harness must copy it before that start.

## The Motion importer tab and the bundled motion importer (2026-10-31, Claude)

- **The part was behind its add-on.** `packages/character-motion-importer` was imported on
  2026-10-30 from `H:\BACKUP_20260815\Modding\ipg\Gmod-Mmd-Motion-Importer`, a clone at 318b054
  (2026-10-07). The add-on's `main` (`origin/main`, and the clone in
  `C:\Users\matt-peng\Documents\Codex\2026-10-17\please-help-me-connect-claude-on\Gmod-Mmd-Motion-Importer`) is at fcd56f4 (2026-10-27).
  7751327 there added the in-game importer: `cl_importer.lua` (1,005 lines: the window, Resolve,
  the job in a coroutine at 12 ms a frame), `cl_import_bake.lua` (1,946: a Lua port of the native
  baker), `cl_import_data.lua` (938: the bundled skeleton), `mmdvmd_import`, the tool's import button,
  and 98 phrases in its eight languages (no Traditional Chinese). 810c0d1 and a03b7af added the
  stage placement and movement options. So the RTX package shipped no in-game importer, and ADR 0049's
  tab could only open the Motion Manager.
- **Line endings.** The add-on's working tree has every Lua file with CRLF (`core.autocrlf`) except
  `cl_camera.lua`, which is LF (40,354 bytes, the size of the blob). The part stores CRLF throughout.
- **Catalogs after the upgrade:** 462 keys in each of the nine (`ar en es fr ja ko ru zh zh-tw`),
  `tools/check_addon_i18n.py` 0 problems.
- **When a creation tab is built.** Sandbox's `gamemodes/sandbox/gamemode/spawnmenu/creationmenu.lua`
  (PoC install) creates a plain `Panel` per tab and, in `timer.Simple(0)`, calls the tab's function,
  parents the returned panel to it and docks it `FILL`: at the start of the session and on every
  `spawnmenu_reload`, not when the tab is first opened. Panels only think while visible, so the motion
  tab builds its content in its first `Think` (as External Models does in `mmdhl/menu.lua`, waiting
  for `mmdhl.CreateLibrary`), which also covers the add-on loading after the companion.
- **External Models' look** (`mmdhl/ui.lua`): text `Color(31,43,58)`, muted `Color(93,109,127)`,
  accent `Color(34,109,185)` (line 4); flat rounded button styles primary, success, warning, danger,
  secondary, tab (lines 27-34, `draw.RoundedBox(4, ...)`, a selected tab filled with the accent); the
  page `Color(246,248,251)` (line 141); the left column `clamp(width * 0.37, 260, 460)` scaled by
  `ScrH()/1080` (line 865). `mmdhl.UI` exports these helpers, but only Model Hotloader uses it; the
  motion importer's light theme copies the colours instead of depending on it.
- **Hooks keyed by a panel.** GMod's `hook.Run` passes a non-string identifier as the first argument
  and drops it once `IsValid` fails, so the builders key their hooks by their root panel: a closed
  window or a rebuilt spawn menu drops them without `OnRemove` (the window still releases its hooks
  and stops the music preview in `OnRemove`, as before).

## R4 release facts (2026-10-31, Claude)

- **GUI Scaler** (Workshop 3495129511, `lua/autorun/client/cl_guiscaler.lua`, the user has it): with
  `guiscaler_only_spawnmenu 1` (its default) it walks the spawn menu's panel tree and, per panel class,
  multiplies `DButton` sizes by `ScrH()/1080 * guiscaler_scale_multiplier` and swaps `DermaDefault`,
  `DermaDefaultBold` and `DermaLarge` for its own scaled fonts; other named fonts stay as they are. It
  marks a processed panel `gScF` and skips one already marked, which is how Model Hotloader's
  `ownScale` opts its resolution-aware panels out. So a tab that sizes itself must mark its subtree, or
  its buttons grow twice while its own fonts do not (the motion importer at 4K before R4-31).
- **The field release runs** (763 subscriptions, 762 mounted, 4K, the user's settings): the map was
  ready 21.6-28.6 s after launch; the four release QA sessions took 6.2-6.3 minutes in all, the PoC's
  4.3. A start right after a publish ran the previous package: GMod fetched the update (1.84 GB)
  during that session, byte-identical to the upload, and the next start deployed it.
- **`steamworks.FileInfo` rounds its numbers to a 32-bit float.** For this project's Workshop items
  (PoC, 2026-10-31) `updated`, `created` and `size` came back rounded to steps of 128:
  `updated` 1793444864 for the 1793444836 in `appworkshop_4000.acf`, `size` 1222846336 for 1222846295
  (Evernight and March 7th; Robin, Guinaifen and the RTX package likewise); `fileid` was 0 and
  `installed` false. Compare such times with a tolerance of one step (`math.frexp`: 2^(exponent-24)).

## Loose glass physics in GMod (2026-10-31, Claude, R5)

Read in the PoC install's shipped Lua and the add-on (`packages/fixes/.../Glass-Rewrite-Remix`) for
[ADR 0061](decisions/0061-loose-glass-breaks-again-and-expires.md):

- **`COLLISION_GROUP_WORLD` collides with the world only.** It is what the No Collide tool's right
  click sets (`gamemodes/sandbox/entities/weapons/gmod_tool/stools/nocollide.lua:76-82`; its text,
  `resource/localization/en/tool.properties:234`: "Make an object have no collisions with anything but
  the world") and the context menu's Disable Collisions (`lua/autorun/properties/collisions.lua:34`).
  The add-on's `rtx_glass_expensive_shards 1` ("collide with everything", the default) put map debris
  and small fragments there; 0 gave `COLLISION_GROUP_DEBRIS`.
- **`COLLISION_GROUP_WEAPON` is GMod's group for props that must not collide with players** ("Don't
  collide with the player": `gamemodes/sandbox/entities/entities/gmod_cameraprop.lua:38-39`,
  `gamemodes/base/entities/entities/ragdoll_motion.lua:52-53`; also `prop_effect.lua:54`). TTT gives
  corpses, "nonsolid to players, but can be picked up and shot", `COLLISION_GROUP_WEAPON` with
  `ttt_ragdoll_collide 1` and `COLLISION_GROUP_DEBRIS_TRIGGER` otherwise
  (`gamemodes/terrortown/gamemode/corpse.lua:368, 392-393`). Traces with `COLLISION_GROUP_NONE`
  (bullets, the physgun, the gravity gun, `+use`) hit these groups.
- **A SENT that defines `OnTakeDamage` reacts to no damage physically.** base_anim's server
  `ENT:OnTakeDamage` is empty (`gamemodes/base/entities/entities/base_anim.lua:57-70`); GMod's own
  entities call `self:TakePhysicsDamage(dmginfo)` in theirs ("React to physics damage",
  `gamemodes/sandbox/entities/entities/gmod_light.lua:46-48`; `gmod_wheel.lua:59`, `gmod_thruster.lua:220`,
  `lua/entities/sent_ball.lua:149-150`). `procedural_shard.lua`'s never did, so bullets and blasts did
  not move shards.
- **`CollisionData.HitObject` is a PhysObj** (no `GetClass`); the entity hit is `HitEntity`. The
  add-on's "two breakable shards do not break each other" test reads `HitObject:GetClass` and never
  matches, so a shard flying into a pane breaks it; its impact mass reads
  `HitObject:GetPhysicsObject`, which does not exist either, so the mass of the other object is always
  1. Both are left as they are (panes' behaviour and the rigidity tuning depend on them); ADR 0061
  adds its own `HitEntity` check for two loose pieces.
- **Clients have no physics copy of a shard.** `BuildCollision` runs on the server only (Split, the
  spawn functions, the tool, `rtx_map_glass.lua`, `OnDuplicated`); the client's `Initialize` calls
  `PhysicsInit` on an entity without a model, which fails. The client `Think` that freezes and pins a
  physics copy (`procedural_shard.lua`) therefore never runs past its first check.
- **The client never defines the crack functions.** `procedural_shard.lua` returns on the client
  right after `UpdateTransmitState` (`if CLIENT then NLP(...) return end`), before `ShowCracks`,
  `UpdateCrackMesh` and `DrawCracks`, so `GLASS_SHOW_CRACKS` finds no `ShowCracks` and no crack is ever
  drawn. Found in R5, not changed.
- **Split sizes.** A split makes `num_radial` (`random(max(2, d-1), d+2)`) plus `num_concentric`
  (`random(d-2, d)`) planes for a depth `d`: 21-26 at the default `rtx_glass_shard_count 12` (a pane's
  first break adds 2-4 to the depth), 3-8 at the loose-piece depth 3. Bounding radius 20 was already
  the size below which a fragment is removed with GlassImpact (`BuildCollision`).
- **Falls.** At `sv_gravity 600` a free fall reaches 300 units/s (a pane's break speed) after 75 units
  and 500 units/s after about 210 (`v^2 = 2gh`); map debris also leaves a window with the damage
  impulse, capped at 350 units/s, plus a random scatter of up to 60 units/s per axis at the default
  velocity transfer 2 (`rtx_map_glass.lua`).

## The night sky line on modern_house (2026-10-31, Claude, R5)

Measured in the field install on `modern_house` with [`night_sky_probe.lua`](../tools/qa/night_sky_probe.lua.md)
and variants (evidence in `out\qa-field\r5-sky\01`-`10`):

- **What it was.** A straight-edged brownish haze over part of the night sky, stars faint inside it and
  crisp outside, and in two views 15-20 s apart the whole scene in daylight. Remix's debug views
  (below) showed no geometry in the sky at all; the haze ran along the edge of the previous view's
  frustum, so it lived in the image's temporal history. Modern House RTX's `MHRTX_Settings` timer
  (20 s, three times, started 3 s after the map: `lua/modern_house_rtx/cl_main.lua:320-328`) re-applies
  its settings, its afternoon sun (`atmosphereSun`) among them; the companion, holding the player's
  night, put it back on its 10 s `nativeloader_sky_owned` timer. Each daylight episode left the
  history. In a tour after the third re-apply, and with the companion following the re-applies, all
  views were clean, clouds on or off.
- **Ruled out on the way:** the night sky image's seams (a CPU render of `evalStarMap`'s three layers
  is seamless), the fixes' Custom 2D Skybox (`rtx_sky2d_enable 0` changed nothing; it draws only with
  the world draw patched out), `r_skybox 0`, Modern House's mirrors, and the clouds' hex de-tiling
  (the haze came with `rtx.atmosphere.cloudHexTilingEnable False` too, and went with it on once the
  re-applies stopped).
- **Sky draws in the physical sky.** With `rtx.skyMode 1` (Numos) `tryHandleSky` drops every draw whose
  camera is Sky (`dxvk-remix-gmod src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_sky.h:85-89`); a draw is Sky when it carries
  the Sky category: its colour texture is in `rtx.skyBoxTextures`, its viewport `minZ` reaches
  `rtx.skyMinZThreshold`, or `rtx.skyAutoDetect` classifies it (`rtx_types.cpp:548-626`,
  `rtx_camera_manager.cpp:111-118`). The modern_house skybox `sky_day02_03`'s face hashes (Remix's
  `RemixMaterial.GetTextureHash`): lf `0x3A6D016CA2191AE0`, bk `0xA512403F9F80897C`, ft
  `0x9225497508AC6197`, up `0x5D47E153E359F0B1`, dn `0x24CA07058BAA92B0` (rt returned 0); none is in
  the package's list, auto-detection classifies them.
- **Remix debug views from Lua.** `RemixConfig.SetConfigVariable("rtx.debugView.debugViewIdx", n)`
  switches the view in a session (`GetConfigVariable` keeps returning `rtx.conf`'s value, 0); useful
  indices (`src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/utility/debug_view_indices.h`): 271 primary depth, 277 geometry hash,
  23 albedo, 22 material type, 166 stochastic alpha-blend background transparency, 876 the cloud
  render target (black at night: its radiance is too dim to show).
- **The clouds' temporal smoothing** blends each frame's cloud layer with a reprojected history
  (`rtx.atmosphere.cloudHistoryWeight`, 0.92 by the comments) and drops history that is off-screen or
  not from the previous frame (`src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/pass/atmosphere/atmosphere_sky.slangh:948-1060`).
  Which temporal pass kept the daylight longest was not isolated.
- **The night sky image's galaxy band is wrapped three times** around the sky, so the Milky Way's core
  shows three times (`evalStarMap`); an observation for the runtime, not changed.
- **A start-up crash in NVIDIA's driver**, twice in about sixteen field starts on 2026-10-31: an access
  violation reading `0xffffffffffffffff` in `nvoglv64.dll+0xe622f8`, on a worker thread of Remix's
  `d3d9.dll` compiling pipelines, about 4 s after the device was created, with the same stack both
  times (`out\qa-field\r5-sky\08-night-sky-debug-views` on the package before R5,
  `out\qa-field\r5-release\03-map-glass` on R5's; both reruns clean). Recorded for the stability work.

## R6 T1: verified layer consumers (2026-10-31)

At runtime commit `6f2dbd79`, `src/dxvk/dxvk_options.cpp:36-39` reads Aftermath and
`rtx.enableGpuCrashState` from the same merged `Config`; a search finds no RtxOption declaration
for that crash-state key. It belongs with the diagnostics layer after package copies despite
its `rtx.` prefix. `src/dxvk/dxvk_instance.cpp:353-359` reads `DXVK_AFTERMATH_DUMP_PATH`
and inserts a slash when needed before naming the dump. Remix layer precedence remains as
recorded in R5 proposal 1: `rtx_option_layer.cpp:51-61,671-706` and `rtx_option.cpp:1156-1186`.

R6 T1 implementation follows byte comparisons rather than rounded GiB: 8.5 GiB = 8704 MiB,
12.5 GiB = 12800 MiB. `loader/core/src/performance.cpp` classifies names without consulting the
runtime preset or adapter ordering. `loader/core/src/activate.cpp` chooses I1 tier files only from
records owned by the selected runtime; the existing proxy validation checks every payload record's
size/time before copying. A missing record uses the approved old-package fallback; an advertised
but missing/changed payload is an activation integrity failure, not an excuse to trust a loose file.

Measured in the synthetic Release host on 2026-10-31: DXGI selected NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090,
32187 MiB dedicated VRAM. Auto was high; explicit low used the pre-R6 fallback and copied the
packaged fixture tier when supplied. `loader/core/src/performance.cpp:46,60` implement selection
and exact thresholds; `loader/core/src/activate.cpp:265,320` select the journal-owned tier and
late diagnostics slot. Two package DXVK copies plus tier, diagnostics and root default total
140 characters (259-character budget). The one-start CREATE_NEW claim is at
`loader/core/src/gpu_diagnostics.cpp:58,63`. The real runtime's effective options and GPU dumps
remain unmeasured by this task; the fixture exercises loader behavior only.

## R6 T4: runtime memory snapshots (2026-10-31)

Source references below are to patch 0015 on the recorded fourteen-patch tree. The review fixes
supersede the initial runtime commit `86ac49e9`; the final identity is in
[runtime/README.md](../runtime/README.md#r6-t4-rebuild-2026-10-31). The user's fork checkout was not changed.

- `DxvkSubmissionQueue::handleDeviceLost` (`src/dxvk/dxvk_queue.cpp:407`) is shared by the submit
  and fence-finish loss paths (`:307`, `:357`).
  It retains the single-handler gate and calls `onGpuCrash(reason)` inside it. The first diagnostic
  work in `onGpuCrash` (`:148`) logs/writes the memory snapshot with the supplied queue reason before
  the crash-state recorder and either Aftermath wait. The bridge notification precedes it and
  returns immediately on the inactive GMod x64 bridge. Another loss thread cannot reach
  Sentry/termination while the first is recording crash state.
  No GPU synchronization is added by diagnostics.
- The VRAM API's collection previously lived in `rtx_fork_api_entry.cpp:864-893`. It now calls
  `RtxMemoryDiagnostics::capture` at line 864. `rtx_memory_stats.cpp` collects all driver heaps,
  bounds the heap loop by the snapshot array's size, labels each with `device_local` (`:43`), and
  sums driver budget/use, DXVK allocations/use and eight categories only across device-local heaps.
  The serialized `driver` totals are the API's
  `driverBudgetBytes`/`driverAllocatedBytes`. It does not
  read the render-owned texture table; the API still adds its cache count separately.
- `DxvkAdapter::getMemoryHeapInfo` (`dxvk_adapter.cpp:79-108`) queries physical-device memory
  properties, rather than waiting for GPU work. With `VK_EXT_memory_budget`, budget/use are driver
  values; without it, budget is heap size and usage is DXVK's tracked heap allocation counter.
  Snapshots preserve those semantics and are approximate cross-thread observations.
- `RtxContext::onPresent` (`rtx_context.cpp:919`) polls a device-owned steady-clock schedule, giving
  one sample per cut frame and every five minutes while frames are presented. Camera cuts do not
  reset the periodic deadline (`rtx_memory_stats_data.h`). The first deadline is five minutes
  after device creation. Cut samples show the outgoing scene before the delayed cut-driven clear
  (`rtx_scene_manager.cpp`, `m_enqueueDelayedClear`). A stopped render loop cannot log a periodic sample.
- OMM is recreated at cuts (`rtx_scene_manager.cpp:3134-3152`), so its two one-minute warning limits
  belong to the device (`rtx_memory_stats.h`). The next eligible occurrence reports the suppressed
  count; no background thread flushes idle warnings (`rtx_memory_stats.cpp`). Device-loss snapshots
  also include both pending counts in `omm_suppressed`, read atomically across threads. The
  budget-dropped branch runs only after its budget is zero, so `getAvailable()` and the new budget
  carry no information there. It now passes `m_vidmemFreeSize`, `m_prevBudget`, `m_used` and the
  hard/soft free-VRAM limits to `logOmmBudgetDropped`, before invalidating the free-VRAM sample
  (`rtx_opacity_micromap_manager.cpp:175-195`). The warning names all five values and their byte units.
- The crash marker uses the same `RtxFileSys::Logs` directory as `remix-dxvk.log`, including
  `DXVK_LOG_PATH` (`src/util/util_filesys.h:65`). `rtx_memory_stats_data.cpp` checks `WriteFile`,
  `FlushFileBuffers` and `CloseHandle` on `last_gpu_crash.<pid>.tmp` before `MoveFileExW` replacement.
  Sharing violations/access denial receive at most three replacement attempts and two 10 ms sleeps;
  write/replacement failure deletes that process's temporary file. A different process's temporary
  file is left alone. `onDeviceLoss` logs first and still attempts the marker if logging throws.
  A failed write keeps the old marker; timestamps must be checked by the next-start reader.
  The timestamp belongs to the captured snapshot, so the marker and log line match even if the
  write crosses a second boundary. The optional `reason` appears identically in the log and marker,
  with quotes, backslashes and control bytes JSON-escaped. Logging and file failures cannot unwind
  through `onDeviceLoss`.
- Patch 0001's snapshot omitted five unit-test sources that its Meson file names:
  `test_particle_system_schema.cpp`, `test_hot_reload.cpp`, `test_rtx_option_dynamic.cpp`,
  `test_gpu_profile.cpp`, `test_gpu_overrides.cpp`; and `apps/RemixAPI/remixapi_medium_test.cpp`.
  All six are tracked, staged additions in the user's mid-merge fork index, not ignored local
  copies. The `.gitignore:63` wildcard hid them from the snapshot operation. Patch 0015 now records
  their staged bytes read with `git show :<path>` and removes the six silent source guards.
  The five unit sources total 3,008 lines; the medium API app is another 377 lines. It is a
  standalone GPU/rendering app, not one of Meson's registered CPU unit tests.
- The development-only GPU crash trigger is real GPU work:
  `rtx_context.cpp:498-503` dispatches `metaGpuCrash()` after Ctrl+Shift+Alt+G when armed by
  `RTX_ENABLE_CRASH_HOTKEY=1` (`rtx_options.h:1092-1105`). It is compiled out without
  `REMIX_DEVELOPMENT` and was not exercised by T4.
- The fork's `scripts-common/install_file_in_dir.bat:2-12` enables delayed expansion before
  assigning its arguments; `install_usd_plugins.bat` also enables it around paths. A source path
  containing `!` is stripped during unit dependency staging. T4 used literal-path PowerShell
  copies into its own unit build after that helper failed. The initial 22-test suite passed; the
  review build passes 27/27 with the five restored unit sources.

## R6 T5 fixes memory-limit compatibility

- `packages/fixes/files.json` initially attributed the native DLL to an aggregate staging path
  (`out/oversized-native-build`) at aggregate commit `04592ae8`; the actual native source is
  pinned in `packages/fixes/licenses/oversized-skinning/build-pins.json`:
  `b23c58fa72e8ac2d9a7dfb0bcad8b03fe247edbe`. Using the fork checkout's `fc478c06` instead would
  lose the later oversized-skinning fixes. The new import stages the DLL inside its native
  worktree, so its origin records native commit `a2c8dbc5e00e3effe49a8de9609dd1b8af34d552`.
- The source delta from that base is four native files: removal of the module-open call
  (`source/module.cpp`, formerly line 431), a no-op implementation
  (`source/remixapi/remixapi.cpp:1329`), its declaration comment (`remixapi.h:298`) and the Lua
  binding comment (`resource_lua_bindings.cpp:75`). The Lua number checks and `true` result remain.
  The README and a standalone regression are the only other changed files. Full snapshots and
  the commit patch are in [the corresponding source bundle](../packages/fixes/licenses/oversized-skinning/memory-limits/Source.md).
- Baseline and changed builds use the same generated projects, dependency revisions,
  `ReleaseWithSymbols|x64`, MSVC 14.44.35207 and Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0. The 4,848,128-byte old
  DLL becomes 4,847,616 bytes. PE x64 imports/exports match; both rejected-key strings occur in
  the original and rebuilt baseline and are absent from the new DLL. HardwareSkinningHooks.cpp
  matches the preceding source hash exactly; the policy header/test match after CRLF normalization.
- The earlier restricted attempt could not write the original fork's `.git`. Its shared bare clone
  under the task's `out/fixes-origin.git` hosts `r6-no-memory-limits`, with its clean worktree at
  `out/fixes-source`; the resumed run preserves that already-committed source and rebuilt DLL.
  Recursive dependencies were archived from locally available git objects at their pinned
  revisions, without fetching or modifying the original checkout. The new commit is unpushed.
  The PM later fetched it into the fixes checkout as `codex/r6-no-memory-limits`; the PDB matching
  the shipped DLL is kept in the main checkout's `out/fixes-memory-limits-build`.

## R6 T5 ToPBR texture compression

- The fixes' `garrysmod/rtx-remix/mods/~gmod_topbr/materials.usda:18-20` marks the flat normal
  texture as `raw`; the roughness reference at `:56-58` does too. A complete reference census
  finds 113 raw references covering exactly 83 files: 33 normal maps and 50 roughness maps,
  no colour maps. `encoding = 0` and all USD files remain unchanged. All source DDS headers
  describe uncompressed BGRA8; retaining RGBA in BC7 avoids dropping any encoded normal channel.
- NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter 2023.4.0 is already installed with RTX Remix at
  `C:/Program Files/NVIDIA Corporation/RTX Remix/exts/omni.flux.resources/deps/tools/nvtt/nvtt_export.exe`.
  CPU-only, highest-quality BC7 with a linear DXGI tag and gamma/premultiplied mip processing
  disabled produces DXGI 98 for every file. Names, dimensions and the full 816 mip levels match
  the originals. See [conversion arguments and hashes](../packages/fixes/licenses/topbr-bc7/conversion.json).
- DDS bytes fall from 142,869,484 (136.25 MiB) to 35,729,420 (34.07 MiB): 107,140,064 fewer
  bytes, 74.9916%. xz inputs fall from 16,454,204 to 15,000,576 bytes. These are disk sizes;

### R6 T1 independent-review corrections (2026-10-31)

The local runtime fork at `6f2dbd79` routes Aftermath files into its existing Sentry GPU report:
`src/dxvk/dxvk_instance.cpp:392` calls `queueGpuCrashReport`; `src/util/util_sentry.cpp:447-496`
attaches the dump to the event and captures/flushes it, and `:858-863` applies the runtime's
consent flow. Dumps written under the loader's local folder may therefore be uploaded when the
player accepts Remix crash reporting. R6 does not alter that reporting policy.

The two new DXVK paths and their commas add exactly 67 characters: tier.conf plus diagnostics.conf.
Regression tests combine them with package copies and a user-supplied DXVK list at 259 (accepted)
and 260 (warning that Remix ignores the list) characters. RTX 5090 D uses the consumer class rule;
GTX 1080 Ti and RTX A2000 Laptop GPU use VRAM alone. The Laptop adjustment runs only after a
consumer RTX class is recognized. Invalid UTF-16 descriptions can throw from filesystem UTF-8
conversion; the startup adapter reader now keeps vendor/VRAM with an empty name instead.
- The second review's offline scratch setup uses the same direct Python/Meson command as
  `runtime/build_runtime.ps1` after `Enter-VsDevEnv`. All 95 recorded build options match the real
  `_CompRelease_x64`, including optimization 3 and the release DLL CRT. Only Meson's compiler
  probes ran; no runtime targets compiled. The scratch folder was deleted after comparison
  (`out/tmp/runtime-review2-setup-comparison.json`).
- T2's reader on integration commit `1dc93125` (`loader/core/src/evidence.cpp:188-202`) parses the
  marker and reads only a string `event`; its JSON parser stores arbitrary object members without
  a field allowlist. Unknown `device_local`, `driver`, `omm_suppressed` and `reason` fields are
  ignored. Its existing `loader/tests/test_evidence.cpp:36-52` checks a minimal device-loss marker,
  optional/unrelated fields and malformed JSON. No loader code or tests changed in this T4 pass.

### R6 harness device-loss freeze (2026-10-31)

Read-only PM evidence in the main checkout's `out/qa-poc/r6/tiers-pinned/session.json`, record
`04-house-auto-pin`, starts at `2026-11-01T00:52:47Z` and finishes at `02:48:47Z`: 6,960 seconds
(1 h 56 min), with `map_loaded: true`, `seconds_to_map: 7.5`, failed mount/map/camera/FPS steps and
exit 3489660927 (`0xCFFFFFFF`). That step's `remix-dxvk.log:990` records
`DxvkSubmissionQueue: Command submission failed: VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`. The old harness only declined
prompts inside startup/map waits and called `PrintWindow` synchronously; a GPU-crash dialog could
therefore outlive those waits and block evidence capture. The R6 harness change checks the current
run's log, watches prompts through exit and bounds capture/shutdown; regression tests use fakes.

## C-16: scene-adaptive emission

Runtime paths below refer to the isolated source built from `runtime/base.json` plus patches
0001-0016; the source is under this task's `out/runtime-src`.

- `src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/pass/tonemap/auto_exposure.comp.slang:143-170` computes the actual
  geometric-mean Yf before the cone-noise division and exposure cap, then smooths exposure in log
  space. Patch 0016 writes `(adaptedYf, exposure)` to an eight-byte buffer at `:170`. This preserves
  the statistic in capped scenes instead of reconstructing it from exposure.
- `src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_auto_exposure.cpp:78-122` checks completed readbacks at a minimum age of
  two frames, selects the newest, clamps the effective luminance and logs the source frame/age,
  Yf and exposure at cuts/five-minute intervals. `:260-264` queues a copy only into an idle slot.
  `DxvkContext::copyBuffer` (`src/dxvk/dxvk_context.cpp:779-843`) records transfer/host access
  barriers and tracks the destination as a GPU write. `DxvkResource::isInUse`
  (`src/dxvk/dxvk_resource.h:38-43`) includes pending writes, so the CPU never reads or overwrites
  an outstanding transfer. No wait or game-side readback stall is introduced.
- `src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/pass/instance_definitions.h:142-143,167-168` limits material indices to
  21 bits. The 32-bit subsurface index therefore has a free high byte. The opaque CPU packer
  (`src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_materials.h:737-744,983-987`) also always sets DLSS mask alpha to 255.
  Those bytes hold a split half-float, with the second XORed by 255 to preserve the legacy bytes
  for input zero. Shared helpers live in `src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/utility/adaptive_emission.h`.
  Shader accessors (`surface_material.h:110-120` in `concept/surface_material`) mask the index,
  restore alpha and recover the half. Both the packed 64-byte record and the CPU object's
  168-byte size are unchanged; the added CPU float consumes existing alignment space.
- The new X-macro input (`src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_material_data.h:60`) participates in USD loading,
  defaults, range sanitization, serialization and hashing. The GPU hash includes it at
  `rtx_materials.h:873,910,946`; `rtx_remix_api.cpp` preserves it through texture preload and uses
  zero for the unchanged public API, and terrain baking uses zero.
- `src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/concept/surface_material/opaque_surface_material_interaction.slangh:557-560,950-957`
  covers the Source-eye override and general opaque evaluation. The latter keeps
  `emissiveBlendOverrideInfluence` intact. The G-buffer decode at `:1035-1054` reads already
  evaluated radiance; scaling it again would apply adaptation twice. Decals and polymorphic
  conversions likewise carry evaluated radiance. Subsurface and RTXCR readers use decoded indices.
- The runtime part's index has no `AperturePBR_Opacity.mdl`. The combined package carries one in
  `packages/fixes/garrysmod/rtx-remix/mods/base_mod/breakable_glass/assets/remix_materials/`.
  Its `AperturePBR_Opacity.mdl:162-170` now declares the input (zero default, 0..65504 hard range,
  description); the MDL preview continues to use fixed intensity. This one plain-text input was
  reimported through `tools/inputs.py`, without changing the other fixes inputs.
- A copied configured tree also needs its shader `.d` files relocated. In
  `scripts-common/compile_shaders.py:75-108,193-201`, timestamp checks follow those stored include
  paths, so removing `_built_shaders.txt` alone can reuse old SPIR-V while reading the original
  tree's unchanged includes. C-16 relocated 694 dependency files in each copied configuration.
  The final Release log records actual shader compilation; disassembly confirms binding 4 and an
  eight-byte `OutAdaptation` stride. `out/tmp/c16-embedded-shaders.json` proves the freshly compiled
  5,888-byte auto-exposure SPIR-V and 74,616-byte opaque G-buffer SPIR-V occur byte-for-byte inside
  the final DLL (offsets 380,900,976 and 12,898,160 respectively). No source or build output in the
  R6 tree or the user's fork was changed.

## G1-B fix pass: real-map collision findings (2026-11-01)

- Read-only gm_construct probe (36,735,656 bytes): baseline considered 2,095 brushes, clipped
  2,092, skipped 3; Jolt refused one hull and aborted the entire world in 55.38 ms. Double clipping
  reduces the maximum hull from 46 to 24 vertices; cooking skips/counts the one remaining refusal.
  The corrected world has 2,094 static bodies (2,091 brush bodies + three terrain mesh batches),
  20,992 displacement triangles, four prop metadata entries (not cooked by the offline probe).
  Initial corrected parse/build: 46.98 ms, standalone parse 14.25 ms. Evidence stays under this
  worktree's ignored `out/g1-native-fix/`; QA logs 01-qa and 02-qa were read only.
- The installed map's displacement tags are 6 (20,801), 2 (122), 0 (69): **zero** SURFACE bits.
  Requiring bit 0 silently discarded all terrain. The local Source SDK reference's
  `public/bspfile.h:624-629` names SURFACE/WALKABLE/BUILDABLE/REMOVE (bits 0/1/2/5).
  Import now omits only REMOVE-tagged triangles; generated tests cover tags 0, 2, 6 and holes.
- The same local reference's `public/builddisp.cpp:1918-1994` interpolates rows along 0->1 and
  columns along 0->3 (`ndx = i * postSpacing + j`); our parser had those swapped. The uneven
  generated fixture now asserts a raised vertex at (200,210,1.25), never its transposed position.
  This was read for format facts only; no GPL implementation was copied.

## G1-B fix pass: background work and pile cost (2026-11-01)

- `glass/native/world.cpp` now snapshots Jolt's old/new active IDs across an update, uses exclusive
  NoLock body access and a dense pose queue, and counts contact/manifold/pair/constraint saturation
  instead of throwing. A generated 128-body overlap saturates the cache and remains ready; the
  ordinary 4,000-body benchmark reports zero overflows. A measured 4 ms catch-up budget permits at
  least one step and at most four, discarding whole excess steps. At 4,000 bodies a .25-second
  dispatch ran one substep and counted .233333 dropped seconds.
- Same-machine pre-fix core baseline: 4,000 live / 8,192 slots, eight workers, 11.0167 simulated
  seconds to sleep, 2.706 s wall / 18.797 s process CPU, 4.094 ms mean / 7.380 ms max active step,
  .0640 ms settled step+poses. Corrected synchronous diagnostic: 11.0167 seconds to sleep,
  3.295 s wall / 22.703 s CPU, 4.983 ms mean / 7.874 ms max, .00162 ms settled. Active worker
  throughput did **not** improve in that comparison; moving it off the client thread is the material
  change. Async dispatch averaged .0134 ms (max .0605); polls averaged .00296 ms (max .0203), while
  the worker averaged 5.434 ms/update. These are native-only measurements, not game frame times.
- `Init(8192)`/map cooking now reserve **zero simulation scratch**, rather than 144 MiB. The first
  active step sizes scratch to live demand and observed peak with a non-aborting fallback. Pair /
  contact capacities are max(1024,budget*8) / max(1024,budget*4). The 4,000-body test held 34 MiB
  scratch and peaked at 30,234,553 requested bytes (28.83 MiB). Doubling contact capacity used
  56 MiB with no useful throughput gain, so the smaller bounded table is retained.
- `module.cpp` Begin/Poll entry points copy BSP bytes before a worker parses/cooks them, and
  asynchronously optimize the final broadphase and step physics. Busy access refuses immediately;
  Stats returns a pre-dispatch snapshot. Cleanup/shutdown joins before freeing the world. Generated
  core and actual binding callbacks cover pending polls, no concurrent mutation, worker exceptions,
  teardown while importing/stepping and foreign realms.
- Read-only gm_construct final probe: 2,095 considered / 2,092 clipped brushes, 3 clipping skips,
  1 Jolt refusal, 20,992 triangles, zero refused mesh batches, four prop records, 2,094 static bodies.
  Standalone parse 15.98 ms, Init .91 ms, parse+cook+finish 53.62 ms. Async enqueue including the
  36,735,656-byte copy took 4.80 ms; maximum poll 1.41 ms; total 78.11 ms. The VFS read still runs
  on the engine thread; this offline probe excludes it and excludes engine prop model extraction.
- LuaJIT mocked-physics comparison of the original 3096b2e helpers against corrected helpers:
  4,000 active manager Think calls .165 -> .135 ms mean; settled .130 -> .026 ms. These include
  the same mock pose filling but exclude real physics, engine mesh uploads and rendering. Spawn
  still constructed all 4,000 meshes in 108 -> 111 ms CPU in this synthetic burst; initial mesh
  creation is not claimed to be cheap. Settled chunk count grows from 3 to 25 in this deliberately
  single-area pile, bounding replacement/wake work. Ordinary game piles span multiple areas.
- `debris_batches.lua` transforms up to 1,800 vertices/frame, accumulating at most 6,000 per mesh
  and uploading one mesh/frame. Valid old chunks remain until the complete replacement exists;
  wake/removal hides only its affected chunk. New arrivals request a later snapshot; removals cancel
  stale staging; failed GPU builds retain old geometry. The Lua harness covers stale unchanged pose
  rows, staged replacements, upload failure/retry, busy-world queues and complete mesh cleanup.

- Final import polling additionally releases its large owned BSP buffer on the worker before
  publishing completion (`World::begin_load`), avoiding a client-side deallocation stall. Final
  gm_construct receipt: synchronous parse/cook/finish 46.60 ms; async owned-copy enqueue 3.79 ms,
  max poll .0069 ms, total 76.12 ms. Geometry counts are unchanged. An unchanged pile area now
  leaves the rebuild work set entirely; only dirty/staged areas enter Think.

## G1 integration: glass in the game (2026-11-01, Claude)

PoC, 1920x1080 windowed, RTX on; runs under the main checkout's `out/qa-poc/g1/`.

- **GMod takes the run speed from the user command's buttons.** A server `SetupMove` hook that adds
  `IN_FORWARD | IN_SPEED` to the move data and sets `SetMaxClientSpeed`/`SetMaxSpeed` to the run speed
  still tops out at the walk speed, 200 units/s (run 06). A `StartCommand` hook in both realms that
  sets the command's buttons and forward move reaches 400 (run 07).
- **Archived Lua convars outlive their add-on.** GMod keeps them in `garrysmod/cfg/server.vdf` (server
  realm) and `client.vdf` (client realm) and restores a value when a later add-on creates a convar of
  the same name, over that add-on's default. The PoC still had Glass-Rewrite-Remix's
  `rtx_glass_player_break_speed "80"`, `rtx_glass_velocity_transfer "2.000000"`, `rtx_glass_rigidity`,
  `rtx_glass_shard_count` and others; with the new system the 80 let a 200-unit/s walk break glass
  (run 08: one impact, 14 % of the pane left). After the one-time reset (run 10) the file holds 250,
  1 and `rtx_glass_settings_version "1"`, and the walk leaves the pane whole.
- **50 panes broken by blasts, same view** (frame mean / p99): old system (run 12, published package
  `0.0.0-dev.20261101052452+2768a059`) empty 8.87 / 10.20 ms, falling 18.18 / 109.13 ms with 361 shard
  entities, settled 10.89 / 14.49 ms with 302; new system (run 10) before 8.75 / 11.77 ms (787 settled
  pieces present), falling 25.31 / 113.22 ms (2,000 live, 1,236 moving; manager 1.69 ms think, 6.99 ms
  draw; Jolt step 1.50 ms), settled 9.74 / 16.39 ms (62 batches; manager 0.16 ms).
- One annealed 96x64 pane breaking into 161 pieces gives a 62 ms frame (run 10 `bullet_break` p99),
  while its fracture costs about 0.7 ms offline: most of the spike is piece creation or Remix taking
  in new geometry.
- modern_house (run 11): the map alone runs at about 19 ms per frame here; 44 native glass panes; a
  window broken by rounds gives 203 pieces; a ragdoll burst 391 live, 25.83 / 161.8 ms while falling.

## R7: alpha in GMod RTX (2026-11-01, Claude)

PoC, gm_construct, noon, 1920x1080; runs under the main checkout's `out/qa-poc/r7/`.

- **GMod RTX draws models with Source's fixed-function shaders**: `Material(...):GetShader()` returns
  `VertexLitGeneric_DX7` and `UnlitGeneric_DX6` although `mat_dxlevel` is 90.
- **Alpha-tested lit materials cut at about 0.7.** Plates with a 16-band alpha ramp (`04-ramp`): every
  `VertexLitGeneric` alpha-test variant (`$alphatestreference .5`, `.2`, with or without
  `$allowalphatocoverage` or `$vertexcolor`) shows only the top bands; `UnlitGeneric` near 0.5. The runtime
  takes the draw's `D3DRS_ALPHAREF` (`src/d3d9/d3d9_rtx_utils.cpp` `setLegacyMaterialState`), so Source's
  DX7 path sends a fixed reference, not `$alphatestreference`.
- **Blended draws are opaque only above `rtx.stochasticAlphaBlendOpacityThreshold`** (0.79 in
  `packages/runtime/layers/classic_remix_defaults.conf`, 0.95 the runtime default) and a stochastic dither
  below. A blended opacity in (`resolveTransparencyThreshold`, that threshold] is skipped by primary rays
  (`shaders/rtx/algorithm/resolve.slangh`, the stochastic early out), while visibility rays attenuate by
  `1 - opacity` (`shaders/rtx/algorithm/visibility.slangh`).
- **Model Hotloader's soft alpha** (`mmdhl_soft_alpha`, default on) draws triangles with partly transparent
  texels blended in the opaque pass under Remix (`native_render.lua`). Columbina's mask (bars 0.65, panes
  0.26) therefore vanished and shadowed her face (`03-columbina`); a root `rtx.conf` threshold of 0.5 drew it
  as in MMD (`05-columbina-thr05`).
- `SetMaterial` on a client-side model did not change what drew in this setup (`01-plates`); a
  `RenderOverride` with `render.MaterialOverride` did (`02-plates`).
- A field game started without `-console` ignored `WM_CLOSE` on its `Valve001` window for 45 s.

## R7-C: one-way bodies and subsequent debris damage (2026-11-01)

- `glass/native/world.cpp:124,223,401` confines body response to kinematic mirrors and coalesces hard
  contact energy in a bounded atomic queue. Jolt sees Source's sampled transforms/masses; Source
  receives nothing. Pair layers keep mirrors away from map/other mirrors and preserve piece-piece off.
- `glass/addon/lua/nlglass/debris_scene.lua:129` extends only living mirrors eight units below their
  feet. A generated native regression with an exact flat-bottomed hull failed to move thin floor
  glass; the extension moves both large and minimum-size pieces while retaining the prescribed path.
  This is an approximation requiring game tuning, not a change to Source movement/collision.
- `world.cpp:465,505,526` prioritizes 32 live-piece regions near the eye, raycasts local glass and
  transactionally bisects convex prisms. Polygon clipping preserves area and thickness; children
  inherit point velocity. `debris.lua:247` stages one replacement/frame, budgeted oldest first;
  `debris_expiry.lua` preserves the original deadline without scanning normal settled pieces.
- [Facepunch's PostEntityFireBullets contract](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:PostEntityFireBullets)
  supplies final per-pellet traces/damage, avoiding callback replacement or predicted duplicates.
  `debris_bullets.lua:38` bounds inspection (256/s), forwarding (64/s globally, 16/s/firing entity),
  recent interest and PVS. Source trace endpoints retain gameplay occlusion; there is no piece stream.
- Offline feature costs on this machine: 96 warm native mirrors plus 2000-piece interest 0.108 ms,
  ray 0.00102 ms mean, native can-split/replacement 0.0197 ms mean / 0.0344 p99; two maximum-input
  shapes cost 2.644 ms, excluding engine extraction. These do not establish RTX frame parity.
  See the [report](handover/R7-C-report.md) for repeat counts, starting/current comparisons, caps,
  evidence paths, limitations and Claude's acceptance steps. G1 run 10 was read only.

## R7-A: Model Hotloader alpha, 2026-11-01

- Read-only verification of Columbina's existing PoC `materials-v5.gma` confirms
  `materials/mmd/275705586db7e069/yan_zhao_16.vmt` binds
  `mmd/t/2c7b2c8505cc6a6e`, with `$alphatest 1`, `$alphatestreference .5`,
  `$allowalphatocoverage 1`, `$translucent 0`, `$vertexalpha 0`. The registered public name
  therefore need not match the texture's own path. Both are in `mmd/`; shared `mmdhl/scmi`
  normal/lightwarp/phong textures are not base-texture candidates.
- The imported hotloader's `lua/mmdhl/native_render.lua:122` builds the soft recipe with the
  source base texture; lines 150-156 bind that texture to the blended copy and create an opaque
  core only outside Remix. Lines 165-166 put decoded metadata in `mmdhl.assets`. Discovering
  those public material paths covers the current Remix soft pass without changing the add-on.
- Claude's supplied `out/qa-poc/r7/04-ramp/console.log:610` reports
  `VertexLitGeneric_DX7`, and line 614 reports `UnlitGeneric_DX6`. The supplied
  `03-columbina/shot-01-noon.png` visibly has the lattice shadow without its surface;
  `05-columbina-thr05/shot-01-noon.png` has white lattice bars and open holes. These are existing
  observations, not a game run by R7-A.
- In the applied runtime, `opaque_surface_material_interaction.slangh:803` calls the shared
  opacity evaluator after texture/vertex operations; `bake_opacity_micromap.comp.slang:131` calls
  that same evaluator for OMM baking. This is the common point at which promoting coverage to
  1 affects both lighting/visibility and micromap classification. Primary-only threshold changes
  leave indirect opacity throughput and visibility attenuation at the old partial value.
- The GPU surface's `data13.z` uses bits 0-15 for existing texture/eye flags and bits 17-18 for
  texgen. Patch 0017 uses bit 16 plus bits 19-30 for MMD alpha and the fixed-point cutoff; the
  256-byte CPU packing contract remains unchanged. `AlphaState` grows from 9 to 12 explicitly
  initialized bytes. Rearranging explicit OMM hash padding retains the 128-byte hash-source
  contract, with materialHash at byte 88 and no implicit padding.
- The existing ADR 0048 BLAS path compares cached geometry flags, combines shared geometry as
  opaque only when every instance is opaque, and rebuilds on incompatible flags. R7-A does not
  mark a partly opaque mesh fully opaque: only the sampled final coverage is promoted.

## R7-C: fast-body discovery and thin-floor contact (2026-11-01)

- Read-only PoC evidence `out/qa-poc/r7/11-interact/console.log:656–662` shows the 30 kg drum
  crossing nine settled pieces with zero movement/body splits. `debris_scene.lua:12,27,57` now
  widens spatial discovery before testing a 0.25 s/192-unit velocity sweep, inspects at most 512
  entries and prioritizes fast bodies before truncating to 128 candidates/96 mirrors. Fast cold
  physics boxes bypass mesh extraction until slowing (`glass/addon/lua/nlglass/debris_scene.lua:128`).
- Earlier Lua capture alone still fails the real Jolt sleeping-floor-box replay. Jolt's
  `third_party/jolt/Jolt/Physics/PhysicsSystem.cpp:1564` limits CCD to dynamic bodies. Native
  `glass/native/world.cpp:236` now sweeps actual mirror translations against glass, with 16 casts,
  eight hits/cast and 64 transfers/snapshot; mirrors still follow Source exactly. The regression
  fails on the starting executable even with earlier captured rows, and passes with both fixes.
- Three interleaved offline comparisons: crowded Lua capture 0.1563 -> 0.1959 ms mean; warm native
  96 mirrors/regions 0.06035 -> 0.05966 ms; single fast box native sync 0.0011–0.0033 ms mean;
  the 96-mirror/128-leaf, 64-transfer stress snapshot 0.0693 ms median. The unchanged 4000-piece
  benchmark settles in 11.0167 simulated seconds, with identical scratch use/zero overflows.
  These are doubles/generated rooms, not game frames; detailed costs and limits are in the
  [fix report](handover/R7-C-report.md#r7-c-fast-body-fix-pass-r7-glass-fix).

## R7 integration: glass capture in the game (2026-11-01, Claude)

- **Vector reads.** Reading a component of a Source `Vector` from client Lua costs **35.3 ns** in
  game: 100,000 reads of `v.x`, against 0.5 ns for a Lua local (PoC, `out/qa-poc/r7/25-probe`).
  R7-C's region test read every bound through vectors. 512 bodies that miss 32 regions took
  **3.128 ms** that way, and **0.300 ms** with the same test on plain numbers.
  - At 10 Hz, the 50-pane field scene's manager think rose from 0.02 ms (interaction off, run 21)
    to 0.49 ms (on, run 24) with nothing moving, with think peaks of 18.6 and 26.4 ms.
  - The offline doubles are plain Lua tables and cannot show this cost.
- **`PhysObj:GetAABB()` is in the object's own frame.** A client prop (`ents.CreateClientProp`, the
  oil drum) at 831, 400, −100, angles 0, 37, 20, reported −14, −14, 0 .. 14, 14, 45.
  - Server props have no physics object on the client: the drum, the couches, the table and the
    companion doll all give an invalid `GetPhysicsObject()` there. Capture uses their oriented
    `OBBMins`/`OBBMaxs` box.
  - Client ragdolls and client props do have one. Capture took their local box as world bounds, so
    the boxes landed near the map origin and the region test dropped them.
- **After the fix.** Frame mean / p99 in ms, manager think in brackets. Same build, interaction off
  (run 27), then on (run 28):

  | Scene | Interaction off | Interaction on |
  |---|---|---|
  | Before the panes | 8.96 / 12.81 (0.02) | 8.85 / 16.58 (0.18) |
  | While 2,000 pieces fall | 26.28 / 134.30 (1.79) | 28.60 / 134.33 (2.61) |
  | Settled | 9.17 / 14.66 (0.02) | 9.32 / 17.25 (0.26) |

  G1 run 10, the old baseline: 25.31 / 113.22 ms falling and 9.74 / 16.39 ms settled. The falling
  p99 is the second-worst of about 150 frames: 113, 134 and 142 ms across runs 10, 27 and 21.

R8-G evidence (2026-11-01): R7 read-only `27-field-off/console.log` and `28-field-on/console.log`
under the main checkout's `out/qa-poc/r7/` record 26.28/134.30 and 28.60/134.33 ms falling
mean/p99, settled 9.17/9.32 ms. Lua draw costs about 6.9 ms at roughly 1330 moving draws; the
remaining engine/Remix ingestion/instance-update costs are not separated by those counters.
The preserved before/after replay now retains 2000/1998 original fragments in 2000/348 rigid
draws (four settled batches on both sides). Exact compound creation is in
`glass/native/world.cpp:409`; split paths reject groups before convex-only access.
`glass/addon/lua/nlglass/debris_detail.lua:20` plans groups without changing polygons;
`debris_mesh.lua:53` recentres the same triangles/sub-hulls. Native body origin includes the
shape COM offset (`third_party/jolt/Jolt/Physics/Body/Body.h:268`), matching the render frame.
Source collision flags are enforced at `glass/native/world.cpp:474`; changing them invalidates
Lua shape cache too. The old server router used 32 fixed recent-break spheres/120 seconds;
`debris_bullets.lua` now takes renewable per-client regions. `debris_melee.lua` observes actual
SWEP traces/stock swings, keeps the wider line/hull result (stock fists use that pattern), then
re-clips a containing Source box before the native sphere cast. Numeric region loops remain.
Primary three-run offline costs and all limits are in [the R8-G report](handover/R8-G-report.md);
raw logs/data stay in `out/r8-g/release-costs`. No RTX game improvement is claimed from doubles.

## R8: noise on Model Hotloader characters after R7 (2026-11-01, Claude)

- **What discards history.** `geometry_resolver.slangh` (fork, `e9460a14`) sets
  `discardRRHistory = surface.hasMaterialChanged || (animated water and the option)`; the pixel then
  writes the DLSS-RR disocclusion value `log(10000)` (RR) or uses the alternate disocclusion threshold
  (NRD) into `PrimaryDisocclusionThresholdMix`. Remix's debug view 128, "Primary Alternate Disocclusion
  Threshold", shows that buffer: white where history is thrown away. `DXVK_RTX_DEBUG_VIEW_INDEX=128` in
  the game's environment turns it on for a whole session; `poc_session.py` passes its environment on.
- **Patch 0017's comparison.** `InstanceManager::updateInstance` set `hasMaterialChanged` also when the
  instance's stored `surface.alphaState` differed from the new draw's in `isMmdAlpha` or the cutoff.
  That stored state is written by `mergeInstanceHeuristics` for a later draw of the same frame (the
  "opaqueness takes priority" merge), and a new instance starts with a default (untagged) state; only
  these two writes exist (`rtx_instance_manager.cpp:954`, `:1149`). The material-hash comparison next to
  it was guarded by `m_materialHash != kEmptyHash`; the alpha comparison was not.
- **Measured on the PoC** (Robin face up on gm_construct, pinned camera, share of the frame centre
  that discards history): G1 runtime 0.0 %; R7 runtime with the companion 37.1 %; R7 with the companion
  stopped before the spawn 0.0 %; R7 with Robin's 166 materials tracked but nothing tagged 0.0 %; R7 with
  Robin's 15 texture hashes tagged by hand 31.4 %; patch 0018 0.0 %. Frame-to-frame difference inside the
  character's surfaces (two consecutive shots, DLSS on): R7 shows a grain over dress, arms and hands
  that G1 and patch 0018 do not (`out/qa-poc/r8/noise-compare.png`).
- **API notes.** `RemixConfig.GetConfigVariable` returns an empty string for the hash-set option
  `rtx.gmod.mmdAlphaTexturesForSession`. Setting it to `""` or to a single dummy hash at runtime did not
  remove tags already applied in these runs (the character stayed white), while adding hashes took effect
  within seconds; treat runtime removal from that set as unreliable.
- **Unit tests.** The fork's Release build includes `tests/rtx/unit`; run them with
  `python -m mesonbuild.mesonmain test -C _CompRelease_x64 --no-rebuild` inside `Enter-VsDevEnv`. Tests
  that load `d3d9.dll` (`test_remix_categories`) need the runtime's NVIDIA/USD DLLs next to
  `_CompRelease_x64\src\d3d9\d3d9.dll`; staged from a deployed runtime folder, all 29 pass.

## R8 integration: two facts from the game (2026-11-01, Claude)

- **`net.WriteVector` is compressed.** Each vector takes 3-66 bits (per component a presence bit, then
  integer and fractional coordinate bits), so a region of a vector and a 32-bit float takes 35-98 bits. A
  receiver that requires 128 bits per region refuses every real message; glass interest did until R8
  (PoC `21-glass-r8`: forwarded hits 0 → 1/6 after the fix).
- **Session cheat variables in the field.** `r_forcehwlight` (created by `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary`, flags 0,
  default 0) breaks GPU-skinned characters only together with `mat_softwareskin 0`: on the PoC, with
  `sv_cheats 1` and `mat_softwareskin 1`, a Lua `r_forcehwlight 1` left Kleiner, Alyx and a citizen right
  (`18-vanilla-control`); R3-016 saw the break once `sv_cheats` had gone 1 → 0 and reset the cheat
  variable. The field's own `autoexec.cfg` line `r_forcehwlight 1` never applies (the variable does not
  exist yet when it runs).

## R8 follow-up: "Not Responding" during long loads (2026-11-01, Claude)

- **What the user saw.** During a long field load the game still drew and its menu updated, yet Windows
  marked the window "Not Responding". GMod's main thread reads no window messages while it remounts
  Workshop add-ons or loads a map: gm_br_complex with 765 add-ons takes minutes. `IsHungAppWindow`
  turns true once a window's thread has gone 5 s without reading messages. Windows then hides the window
  behind a **ghost**: a top-level window of class `Ghost`, owned by `dwm.exe` on this Windows 11 build
  (26300), with the game's title and, once marked, " (Not Responding)". The ghost offers to close the
  program; 0xCFFFFFFF is the exit code of a program closed that way.
- **The ghost needs no input.** On the PoC (`out/r8-ghosting/poc`, run `a-kept`, with
  `NATIVE_LOADER_WINDOW_GHOSTING=1`), a 25 s client-Lua busy loop made the window hung for 20.1 s. A
  ghost was there 0.25 s after `IsHungAppWindow` turned true, before the watcher's first invalidation.
  A 2.3 s hang during start-up had a "(Not Responding)" ghost too.
- **`DisableProcessWindowsGhosting`** (user32, no arguments) turns ghosting off for the calling process
  for the rest of its life. `IsHungAppWindow` still reports the hang, so `poc_session.py`'s hang grace
  works unchanged. The loader calls it at start-up, before the engine creates its window. It resolves the
  function at run time, as `activate.cpp` does for user32, so the bootstrap's import table stays
  KERNEL32-only. PoC run `b-fixed` (loader 0.12.1, the same stall): hung for 20.1 s, three invalidations,
  **no ghost window**, a normal quit; loader note `window ghosting off`.
- **In the field, with the player's saved video settings** (`out/qa-field/r8-ghost`, gm_br_complex, 765
  add-ons): with `NATIVE_LOADER_WINDOW_GHOSTING=1`, 5 hang episodes (longest 8.0 s) and 5 ghosts; with
  the fix, 6 episodes (longest 12.1 s) and none. The Workshop mount and map load took 29.8-37.7 s in these
  runs, against minutes earlier the same day.

## R8 CI: glass mirrors behind dropped catch-up steps (2026-11-01, Claude)

- **Symptom.** `build.yml` failed on four of the five pushes to `main` after the R7 merge (runs
  41308841564, 41347922720, 41354364348 and 41355549858; 41357362175 passed), each time in
  `nl_glass_tests` with a few misses of `test_interaction.cpp:166` (three, and two, in the logs read):
  the Source mirror within .01 units of the synced box after `step`. Two of those runs also failed
  `nl_exit_observer_integration` separately: its loader log had no `exit observer ready` note (the
  loader waits 3 s for the observer, `loader/proxy/observer.cpp:175`). This fix does not cover that.
- **The runner.** This private repository's `windows-2022` runner has 2 vCPUs: `hardware_concurrency()`
  is 2, so `world.cpp:181` starts one Jolt worker (the G1-B benchmark line reads `workers=1`), and
  CTest runs `nl_glass_tests` beside five other tests. Pinning a local run's affinity to two cores
  leaves `hardware_concurrency()`, and so eight workers, unchanged.
- **Cause: the 4 ms catch-up budget, not the worker count.** `step_impl` always runs one 1/60 s substep
  and further catch-up substeps only while the measured `elapsed + last_fixed_ms` stays under 4 ms
  (`world.cpp:704`); a whole step still due is discarded (`dropped_seconds`). At dt 1/30 a first substep
  over about 2 ms, such as a preempted thread on a busy machine, dropped the second, and the mirror's
  kinematic interpolation (`m.remaining`, the snapshot interval; `world.cpp:708`) stopped halfway.
- **Reproduced on Linux** (clang 18 with the module's Jolt options, the unchanged test file, under the
  git-ignored `out/repro-glass`): pinned to one CPU that a busy loop shares, one to four misses per
  run, with two workers. Each was a 1/30 s frame with `substeps` 1, `step_ms` 4.2-6.2 and 1/60 s dropped,
  and the miss was exactly half a frame: 650/60 = 10.83 or 3600/60 = 60 units. There were none unloaded.
- **The game hit it too.** The add-on syncs and steps with one interval (`debris_scene.lua:246`,
  `debris.lua:495`), so a loaded 30 FPS client takes the same path. With every catch-up step dropped
  (budget 0, 36 snapshots at 30 Hz), the old code left the mirror a whole frame behind (21.67 units
  at 650 units/s). It moved the mirror at twice Source's speed in simulated time, and the next sweep
  counted the backlog as speed. At 3600 units/s the backlog took every second snapshot over the
  128-unit teleport limit (`world.cpp:544`): 18 of 36 snapshots were never swept.
- **Fix.** Discarded catch-up time now moves each mirror through the same share of its sampled motion
  as a pose correction (`skip_mirrors`, `world.cpp:288`); the snapshot's sweep had already covered that
  path. Budget 0: no lag, and 36 of 36 snapshots swept. Contended runs at the default 4 ms: one to six
  drops per run and no misses (before: one miss per drop).
- **Tests stop racing the clock.** `World::set_catch_up_budget` (C++ only, 0-1000 ms) lets a test run
  every catch-up step (1000) or drop every one (0). The fast-box case runs both. A new case checks the
  snapshot clock, including a .045 s snapshot (2/60 of its motion done, the rest kept for the next step).
  The `substeps==4` check in `test_glass.cpp` had the same race and now pins 1000. Without the fix the
  pinned cases fail on an idle machine (108 and 10 misses).
- **The same race in the Lua scene harness.** Main's run 41359603305 also failed the Python test
  `test_collision_flags_default_living_exclusion_and_independent_categories` at
  `glass_interaction_harness.lua:157` ("flag changes resend cold native shapes"). `debris_scene.lua:170`
  cooks a second shape in one snapshot only while the capture has taken under 0.5 ms, and the harness's
  `SysTime` was `os.clock()`, which is wall time on Windows. A simulated clock that gains 1 ms per call
  reproduces the failure on Linux (0.3 ms passes), and only `scene_flags` depends on it. The harness now
  answers `SysTime` with its Source clock, as `glass_debris_harness.lua` already did. `sceneperf` still
  measures QueryPerformanceCounter, and the game's budget is unchanged: a slow frame cooks that shape in
  the next snapshot.

## R8 CI: the exit observer and the coarse clock (2026-11-02, Claude)

- **Symptom.** `nl_exit_observer_integration` failed in five CI runs since R7 (41308841564,
  41354364348, 41359603305, 41359867098 and 41362392767), each time in one case of 16 (a different one
  in the runs read). The loader log
  had no `exit observer ready` note, so start-up had waited out its 3 s budget. The cloud session's
  probe (`claude/sweet-cori-iqcvoh`, run 41362889676) showed readiness is fast on the runner, even
  beside the other CTests: 45 of 45 ready in 14-226 ms. Slowness was not the cause.
- **Cause: two clocks.** The observer refused a session start earlier than the game's creation time
  (`observer.cpp`, `start < created`). The loader records the start with `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime`
  (`evidence::now_filetime`), which moves once per clock tick. `GetProcessTimes` reports a creation
  time that is not on that tick grid. On this machine the timer runs at 1 ms (`NtQueryTimerResolution`:
  current 10000, coarsest 156250, finest 5000, in 100 ns units), and a tiny program's coarse clock at
  `main` led its creation time by 1.2 ms or more in 400 of 400 starts (`out/r9-ci/clock_race.c`), so
  it never failed here. A runner at Windows' default 15.625 ms tick reads a start up to 15.6 ms behind.
  A loader that records its session within one tick of process creation therefore lost its observer.
- **Fix.** `exit_report::session_after_creation` allows two coarsest ticks (31.25 ms). The other
  identity checks still pin the game: pid, exact creation time, inherited handle, parent process and
  image path. A refusal now exits with `0x4E4C0000` plus its reason, and start-up waits on readiness
  *or* the observer's exit.


## R9-G: glass fracture, latency and environment (2026-11-02, Codex)

- `glass/native/fracture.cpp:50` implements seeded oblique hit-centred 2-6-way clipping down
  to one square unit, replacing longest-axis binary cuts and a four-unit size floor.
  Across 40 Lua seeds per kind, smallest initial annealed/tempered fragments measure
  0.030804/6.674136 units^2; repeated native polygon cuts retain area within 0.02 units^2 on 3072.
- `glass/native/world.cpp:278` marks mirror overlaps; pose corrections include the next swept
  shard extent. An initial reproduction still reversed 7/672 samples at -112.717 units/s when
  a mirror corrected ahead of a previously swept shard; swept-extent suppression removes that
  path. Final generated free-flight fixtures report 0/672 reversals with exact Source targets.
- The real gm_construct BSP has one water brush: min(-3072,1985,-960), max(1856,6464,-160).
  `nl_glass_import_probe <map.bsp> --water` parses/prints it read-only. `world.cpp` applies Jolt's
  submerged-volume impulse at density ratio 0.4, linear drag 1.4 and angular drag 0.08. In the
  PoC, 25 pieces entered water; mean vertical speeds were -125.234 before entry (0.2 s),
  -22.691 at 0.5 s and -32.099 at 1 s, rather than continuing a free fall.
- Valve's [basegrenade_shared.cpp](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/src/game/shared/basegrenade_shared.cpp)
  sets ReportedPosition to the thrower's location, not the explosion. The old fallback preferred
  it. R9 uses the inflictor or an exact API origin/radius. Five PoC routes reached glass without
  relying on damage victims: util blast, explicit env_explosion, native grenade, barrel and RPG.
  Contrary to a source-only assumption about direct C++ InputExplode calls, GMod's AcceptInput
  observes the native barrel/RPG env_explosion too. No polling or save-field guess is required.
- Vanilla GMod resolves all six glass_impact_soft/hard1-3.wav and glass_sheet_break1-3.wav files.
  Native events cap at 128; the client limits 4/frame, 24/s burst 24, 0.12 s/piece and 1536-unit
  distance. Event callbacks never invoke Lua/Source. Empty reads avoid Lua table allocation.
- `tools/tests/test_render_guard_addons.py:111` checks an exact source inventory. New helpers
  must remain in existing trusted paths: Preview in debris_detail.lua, Audio in debris_draw.lua
  and blast observation in server.lua. The loader inventory and trust rules were left intact.

Raw/paired evidence: this worktree's `out/qa-r9/trusted-feature-costs`, `trusted-load-costs`,
`native-frozen-evidence.log`, `latency-summary.json` and owned PoC sessions. See
[the R9-G report](handover/R9-G-report.md) for the full numbers, QA and limits.

## R10-H: PMX identities, expression meanings and map readiness (2026-11-02)

- In nanoem `30acffaa29f5d2eb9e997d69418f2e4b97b5894f`,
  `nanoem/nanoem.c:5962-5980` reads a VMD morph's 15-byte field as CP932;
  `nanoemBufferGetStringFromCp932` (`:699`) ends at NUL.
  `emapp/src/Model.cc:3777` visits each model morph with its original Japanese
  name, and `emapp/src/model/Morph.cc:179` finds/interpolates motion keys by that
  exact name. Windows `nanoem/ext/mbwc.c:98,212` uses
  `MultiByteToWideChar(932,0)` and `wcscmp`, with no NFKC/case/prefix folding.
  Sources: [VMD parser](https://github.com/hkrn/nanoem/blob/30acffaa29f5d2eb9e997d69418f2e4b97b5894f/nanoem/nanoem.c),
  [model synchronization](https://github.com/hkrn/nanoem/blob/30acffaa29f5d2eb9e997d69418f2e4b97b5894f/emapp/src/Model.cc),
  [Windows strings](https://github.com/hkrn/nanoem/blob/30acffaa29f5d2eb9e997d69418f2e4b97b5894f/nanoem/ext/mbwc.c).
  A local Windows API probe checked all 60 lead bytes × 255 non-NUL followers:
  valid Python CP932 mappings agree; every invalid pair produces U+30FB and
  consumes both bytes. A dangling lead at byte 15 also becomes U+30FB. This
  matters when a long VMD name ends halfway through a Japanese character.
- The hotloader's native `rig.cpp:405` retains `{mmd,name,original,displayName,
  namingSource,native}`, disambiguates duplicate English names with index
  suffixes, then assigns at most 96 native controllers. Packaged
  `carrier.lua:GetMorphWeight/SetMorphWeight/SetMorphWeights` (baseline
  `1c12083:126-156`) already reads/writes overflow weights via NW2 and native
  SetMorph; the motion importer had only used Source Get/SetFlexWeight.
- The importer had discarded custom VMD identities in
  `cl_import_bake.lua:flex_tracks_of` and merged by English `track.g`. R10 keeps
  every decoded identity and merges by `track.m`. The existing `sh_core.lua`
  implements exact identity and the overflow adapter; `carrier.lua`
  reads bounded PMX side summaries without changing native controller names.
- Corpus statistics count each NFKC name once per model (first occurrence),
  preserving exact names for binding. Of 1,009 models with 笑い, 999 move both
  sides, one the left, nine have no measurable geometry. ウィンク moves left
  in 971 models and right in 21; ウィンク右 moves right in 955 and left in 22.
  ウィンク2 moves left in 945 and right in 34; ウィンク2右 moves right in 920
  and left in 34. Different duplicate/whitespace policies explain small
  differences from the brief's initial tally. All 345 `EL_Happy_l_CLO` instances
  move character-right, and all 345 `_r_` instances move character-left.
  The [user's reference table](https://github.com/Sinsax/mmd-facial-expression)
  uses opposite-looking wink-side descriptions; geometry supplies our sides.
- Unit-weight standard group recipes link 笑い to the two `EL_Happy_*_CLO`
  halves in 336 models, まばたき to `biyan` in 336, and the vowels to
  `jawOpen_a/yi/wu/ei/o` in 336. The 48-file offset sample corroborates several
  of those and finds 悲しい equivalent to 困る in three models. The generated
  table accepts 62 unambiguous aliases with >=3 observations. These are model
  observations, not a count of independent authors. Raw evidence and rejected
  candidates stay in `out/r10/corpus-analysis.json`; only aggregate fixtures ship.
- Across 1,225 models × 19 unique morph labels retained in the user's Robin
  built cache: exact 15,930/23,275 (68.443%), meaning 234 (1.005%), unresolved
  7,111 (30.552%). A built header cannot include discarded/unresolved source
  tracks, so this is illustrative unweighted label coverage. Both actual PoC
  characters resolve the required expressions by original identity; the
  baseline/after table is in [the report](handover/R10-H-report.md).
- `actors.lua:RegisterActor` used to publish entries without checking material
  mounts or explicitly populating the new server's modelprecache table. GMA
  mount state and that table have different lifetimes. The new `ReadyActor`
  gate checks mounts and server precaching before registration or factory spawn.
  The mount memo now rechecks a visible file, and the actor requires its exact
  carrier model. Group sides combine signed vectors before measuring, so
  cancellation cannot make a one-eye group look bilateral. Bone/UV/material/
  stepped flip effects remain unknown for semantic side selection.
  [IsValidModel](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.IsValidModel) also depends
  on server precaching; [PrecacheModel](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.PrecacheModel)
  is server-only. The baseline PoC spawned successfully after map transitions;
  a later full-map baseline session exited `0xC0000374`. Neither fact is a
  reproduced model-not-found message. The offline regression isolates readiness
  by resetting precache while leaving archives mounted.

R10-H final PoC: `out/r10/qa-certified` records successful stock-menu and actual
client library RequestSpawn/status spawns across construct/flatgrass/construct,
a fresh flatgrass start and a two-slot listen server. The cold Workshop baseline
also succeeds with March 7th's first NPC after a map change; the field error is
still not reproduced. `out/r10/qa-expression-clean` has six real v2/_fm2 builds,
eight screenshots and 201 server ticks each. Exactly the requested original
morph ends at 1, other observed controls at 0; max ramp error is 4.85e-8.
Final cold byte-snapshot geometry reads are 36.2/140.0 ms for Guinaifen/Robin,
versus the first file-call implementation's 2395/3721 ms; cached reads are
0.001–0.002 ms. Exact binding does not scan geometry. Final sessions exit 0,
normally, with zero Lua errors; see [the report](handover/R10-H-report.md).

## R11-A automatic PBR (2026-11-02)

- The shipped ToPBR worker called `ExtractMaterialPBR`, which resolves live IMaterials. The R11
  fixes branch now snapshots one name per client frame, with two ready jobs and an 8192-name cap;
  decoding/writing use value-only jobs. Source material-name negatives are session-local. Output
  keys include source bytes and the scalar/string recipe, rather than size/time alone.
- The old `rtx_topbr_stats` called removed Lua methods and failed on the PoC. Disabling conversion
  stopped work but left USD replacements active. Complete atomic snapshots now support updates,
  removals and independent world/game switches. Native generated USD edits are preserved before
  replacement. Full dependency verification matched 2,334 files after checkout line-ending
  normalization, restoring 59 omitted build files under the isolated out tree.
- [EndfieldLitInput.hlsl](https://github.com/congyuxiaoyoudao/Endfield_Character_Rendering/blob/master/Assets/Shaders/Library/EndfieldLitInput.hlsl)
  lines 287?304 use P red for cloth metallic, alpha for smoothness, **blue for AO**, and separate
  hair/skin rules. Treating it as HDRP's green-AO layout would be wrong. This is a community shader
  reconstruction, not an official game specification.
- [HoyoToon's WuWa shader](https://github.com/Hoyotoon/HoyoToon/blob/main/Shaders/Wuthering%20Waves/Include/HoyoToonWutheringWaves-program.hlsl)
  reads RG normals, uses diffuse alpha for shadow/hair masks, and uses normal alpha to attenuate
  specular. Those masks are not assumed to be plain metallic/roughness. R11 uses RG relief plus
  named PMX material classes, retaining original diffuse/coverage.
- A 512-pixel blurred curl check on the sampled normal maps favored DirectX Y for WuWa
  (DX/GL error ratios 0.446?0.875) and Silver Palace (0.477?0.900), but OpenGL Y for Endfield
  (1.532?1.766); R11 flips Endfield green. These are measured inferences, not official shader
  documentation. The raw observations are in `out/r11-autopbr/normal-conventions.json`.
- PMX `first`/`count` material spans and vertex UVs distinguish shared cloth/metal from skin.
  The native converter bounds the file/vertex/index/string counts and raster work, preserving
  original-class texels in overlaps. Shader maps are at most 2048, decode sources at most 4096,
  and new DDS output at most 1 GiB per module session, with a 64 MiB free-space reserve.
- A read-only scan of 730 installed Workshop GMAs covered 21,101 VMTs. It found MWB/BFT candidates
  (notably items 2459720887 and 3333148722), but no ExoPBR/GPBR matches. Those formats therefore
  have generated-fixture channel tests; absence of a local sample is not rendered acceptance.
- Runtime `rtx_asset_replacer.cpp:getReplacementMaterial` returns the first matching mod, while
  `rtx_mod_manager.h:ComparePtrs` uses path order for equal priority. The fixes API exposes no
  fallback rank. Polling USD files can suppress known conflicts, including a Unicode-later folder,
  but cannot guarantee priority at an asynchronous runtime swap. This remains the R11 integration
  blocker ([ADR 0091](decisions/0091-automatic-pbr-fallbacks.md)).

The final QA measurements, limitations, artifact identity and evidence paths are in the
[R11-A report](handover/R11-A-report.md). No model or generated game texture is committed.

R11-A profiling follow-up: Construct's 45-material conversion p99 fell from 23.472 to 9.133 ms,
and maximum main-thread snapshot from 23.553 to 0.830 ms, after worker-side VMT preparation and
companion probing. Steady medians were 7.270 ms off / 7.213 ms on / 7.374 ms restored, within
run-to-run variation. Measurements use wall clock, not GMod's 100 ms-clamped frame value.

The valid Unicode-later authored fixture hot-reload removed overlap hash `C5E74CB23318460D` in
0.805 s; subsequent captures render the authored red atlas. This measured delay is why the
fixes-side exclusion cannot be claimed as instantaneous runtime precedence. The earlier invalid USD
fixture was rejected and is not rendered acceptance.

R11-B second review (2026-11-02): fixes `633fd5e` puts the identity cache in production
`game_registry.h:83` (`GameRegistry::Session`), instantiated in `to_pbr.cpp:4707` for each worker.
`ClearCache` calls `CancelPendingWork`, which joins/stops that worker before clearing registrations;
the next invocation therefore gets a fresh cache while the persistent registry survives. Its native
regression makes both DDS and registry unavailable after the first resolution and still reuses the
result for new live hashes; distinct identities and no-maps/rejected results have separate coverage.

The former USD ownership map was a function-static process-local table, so a new process could not
recognize its predecessor's generated bytes. `usda.cpp:154-207` now reads/writes a versioned
`.last-published` byte-count/FNV-1a record beside each USD target, after successful replacement.
The production USD regression republishes in separate child processes with no new backup, then
checks same-size edits, missing/damaged/stale records and real sharing violations on USD/sidecar
replacement. DLL: 5,167,104 bytes, SHA-256 `526a6584d4ab68e657b7f1cead25db88beb6cbfa568ad31f92028ddc3345f792`;
build, regressions and Release evidence are in `out/r11-b/second-review`. The GPL source copy and
cumulative patch reconstruct 23 changed files from `7094baf` after CRLF normalization.

The second-review PoC pair (`09-second-source` / `10-second-missing`) publishes the same 7/0/7;
fresh conversions are 7/0 and cached restorations 0/7. Alf's two hair materials share live identity
`mmd/t/222255a4ff9840e9` and `Textures\T_AlfDefault_Hair01_A_D.png`, with one conversion line.
The restarted source-hidden session leaves the entire materials-backup inventory unchanged.
On-state USD stays 6,574 bytes (`97a0f545...`), registry 1,879 (`615a9d85...`), and actor/camera
bounds match the accepted pair. Both exit 0 with no Lua errors or device loss. The field activity
gate waited ten minutes before the first launch; neither preflight found a field game running.
Steam's Workshop package had advanced since the PoC's previous deployment, so restoration used
`nlctl rollback` (generation 145), verifying all 1,871 deployed files against actual pre-pair hashes
instead of applying the newer archive. All 191 snapshot files and 2,877 depot files validate; the
same `autoexec.cfg` user-config difference remains. The PoC lock is released.

## R14-H: capturing the guide's pictures (2026-11-03, Claude)

**The spawn menu's tool panels.** `spawnmenu.GetTools()` is a list sorted by tab name, and the tool
menu keys its panels by place in it (`toolmenu.lua:24-46`), so `GetToolMenu():GetToolPanel("RTX Remix")`
is nil; look the place up by `Name`. `spawnmenu.ActivateTool(<item>)` (`includes/modules/spawnmenu.lua:101`)
opens an item's panel as a click on it does, and highlights it without unfolding its group. A click on
a group's header (`DCategoryHeader`) folds the group instead: the header of Start here has the same text
as its item, which is why the first pass's label clicks left the previous panel showing.
`DHorizontalDivider:SetLeftWidth` applies at the next layout, and the spawn menu's first layout after
opening puts back the cookie's share (`dhorizontaldivider.lua:85-98`); set it, `InvalidateLayout(true)`,
and set it again a moment later. A 640-pixel tool half shows the RTX Remix panels without most of their
wrapping at 1920x1080 (the default is the 460-pixel minimum).

**GMod blocks** `showconsole` and `hideconsole` from `RunConsoleCommand` ("Command is blocked!").

**Remix's menus (Alt+X) from outside.** `RemixConfig.SetConfigVariable("rtx.showUI", "1"/"2"/"0")`
opens the simple menu, the developer menu, or closes them (the option is NoSave). Mouse messages posted
to the game window do not reach them while the real cursor is elsewhere: the ImGui backend polls
`GetCursorPos` and `TrackMouseEvent` reports the mouse leaving. Posted keyboard messages do (Path A of
`rtx_fork_overlay.cpp:115-126`, keyboard navigation is on at `dxvk_imgui.cpp:664`), and Page Down pages
the developer menu down to its Settings Management section (`dxvk_imgui.cpp:1166`); but the keys also
reach the game's binds (the field's `config.cfg` binds End to `quit`, the arrows turn the view).
- The simple menu is **User Graphics Settings**, tabs General, Graphics, Content, Permissions
  (`rtx_user_menu.cpp:214-241`); its buttons are Developer Settings Menu, **Save Settings** (saves the
  user layer, user.conf; orange while it has unsaved changes, `rtx_user_menu.cpp:261-292`) and Delete
  All User Settings. Graphics Preset is on its Graphics tab; DLSS Preset (Disabled, Enabled, Custom)
  on General.
- The developer menu ends with **Settings Management** (`dxvk_imgui.cpp:1166-1290`): "User Settings
  (user.conf):", View Changes (only with unsaved changes), Save, Discard Changes, Delete All, Remove Dupes
  (`rtx_option_layer_gui.cpp:289-350`), then "Developer settings to migrate: N" and the yellow Migrate
  button only when user.conf holds developer settings (83 on the PoC), then the same for "Remix Config
  (rtx.conf):".

**The guide's pictures in the game.** A JPEG material drawn with `surface.DrawTexturedRect` at its own
size and an integer position is pixel-exact (`out/r14-guide/s7/check` in the r14-guide worktree):
pictures are captured at 1920x1080, cropped and never scaled, and are at most 900 pixels wide, the
guide page's width in a 1280x720 game.

**The PoC's characters.** Of the PoC library's nine characters, Karin (`c329babf`) is an Endfield
character with game maps (`t_actor_karin_hair_01`) whose `目白` the eye-white rules detect; 鳴潮_白蓮's
`eye` and `eye+` are not detected.

## R15: painted shadows and alpha on hair (2026-11-04, Claude)

**Where an imported part's alpha goes.**
- The Model Hotloader's AssetInfo (`native.AssetInfo`, `module.cpp:242`) gives per part `base` as the
  cached texture's SHA-256 (`''` when untextured), `alphaTexture` from the texture cache
  (`assets.cpp:393`), `translucentTexture` (partial texels over a tenth of the visible ones,
  `assets.cpp:439`) and `softTriangles`. The texture's path in the model is only in the asset's
  `data/mmd_hotloader/assets/<id>/manifest.json` (`materials[i].base`, keys sorted, 3-350 KB in the
  field library).
- The rig's materials (`rig.cpp:422`) have the same order as the asset's: slot `i`, bodygroup `i+1`,
  `defaultHidden` for authored alpha 0.
- `mmdhl.SyncMaterialState` (`materials.lua`) re-sends the per-part `visible` array every 8 frames per
  character and right after a local edit; the native renderer draws only visible parts in every pass,
  so leaving a slot out there changes the draw and nothing else.
- In GMod, `IMaterial:GetInt("$alphatest")` returns nil for the hotloader's VMTs; the state is in
  `$flags`: `MATERIAL_VAR_ALPHATEST` 256, `MATERIAL_VAR_TRANSLUCENT` 2097152. `Material("!mmdhl_soft_v1_...")`
  returns the procedural soft copy. Laevatain's hair (PoC, `out/r15/alpha2`): public flags 536881424 ->
  536881168 and soft copy 2107408 -> 10256 made its bangs clean, as the user's removal of `$alphatest` did.
- ADR 0081's runtime category replaces the alpha-test reference of categorized MMD draws with
  `rtx.mmdAlphaCutoff` (0.5), so a lower reference on the material does not reach the ray tracer. Only
  a draw without alpha state is opaque there.

**Hair textures in the field library** (159 models, read only; `out/r15/scratch/partial_runs.py` in
the `r15` worktree):
- Laevatain's `T_actor_laevat_hair_01_D.png` (2048²): clear 3.6 %, alpha 9-127 1.6 %, 128-246 3.4 %,
  opaque 91.4 %. Its partial texels lie at the strands' ends and in spots inside them.
- In every hair texture with partial alpha, 85-100 % of the partial texels are in horizontal runs of 16
  texels or more, and 0-3.8 % of them touch a clear texel: masks and fades, not anti-aliased strand edges.
- Reading the whole 2048² VTF (22 MB) in Lua took 8 ms and sampling a 256² grid 1 ms (PoC); the
  controller reads only the sampled rows (8 KB each) through `file.Open`/`Seek`/`Read`.

**Painted shadows in the field library** (6,684 parts): the rules hide 92, all of them shadows: 目影
untextured black at alpha 0.2-0.5 (Endfield, Wuthering Waves) or painted from 黑.jpg/灰.jpg (Star Rail),
发影/髮影/髪影, まぶた影 and 表情_影 painted from the face atlas (LycoReco), Tda's `hairshadow` from the face
texture, SilverWolf999's 陰影 parts, Laevatain's `Moyin` (name) and `Hair+` (untextured, black, alpha 0.5,
0.039 % of the indices). Kept: Evanescia's lavender `Mat_EyeShadow_01` (alpha 0.76), two 眼影 painted
from a coloured texture, and parts hidden as authored. Fifteen models (Star Rail's `眼睛1` at alpha 0.3
from 脸.png) have a part that only the texture's path could decide; none of them is a dark image.

**The render guard's table** held 351 paths at `main` 786d9a9, not the 345 its docs said; with R15's
three companion files it holds 354.

**Client modules.** `nativeloader_eye_whites.lua` `include`s `nativeloader/eye_white_names.lua` and
`eye_white_vtf.lua`, which no `AddCSLuaFile` sent; a client joining a server did not have them. R15's
`nativeloader_i18n.lua` sends them with its own two rule modules.

## R16: the sky at a map's start (2026-11-04, Claude)

- Remix API option writes go to the **User layer**: `remixapi_SetConfigVariable` calls
  `option->readOption(newSetting, RtxOptionLayer::getUserLayer())` (fork `c6b48ed1`,
  `src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_remix_api.cpp:1730`). The layers, weakest first: dxvk.conf, the built-in
  per-application config, rtx.conf, a base game mod's rtx.conf, the derived, environment and quality
  layers, then the User layer (user.conf), the strongest (`rtx_option_layer.cpp:637-690`). So a value
  saved in `rtx.conf` never outranks the companion's live writes; one in `user.conf` is in the same
  layer and is replaced by the next write.
- `rtx.autoUnblockOptionEdits` concerns only edits made in the Remix menu that a stronger layer
  overrides: they clear the stronger value instead of asking (`rtx_option_blocking_popup.cpp:92`).
- The RTX fixes' light updater (`rtx_lightupdater 1`) writes `rtx.ignoreGamePointLights`,
  `...SpotLights` and `...DirectionalLights` `False` 0.5 s after InitPostEntity
  (`cl_rtx_settings.lua:307-354`); their map configs (`data/remix_map_configs/<map>.txt` or
  `default.txt`) load 1 s after it (`cl_remix_map_configs.lua:437-455`). The companion's own 5 s re-send
  puts the directional lights back to `True` for the physical sky.
- A trace of every sky option write (time, value, result, caller; `out/r16/skytrace` in the main
  checkout) with the field player's settings showed the sky sent at InitPostEntity (2.1-2.6 s after the
  client's Lua started) and kept on a new game, a map change, a listen server and with the field's
  `rtx.conf`; in the field on gm_construct too. On `modern_house`, Modern House RTX loads after
  InitPostEntity (`MHRTX_Config` absent then), sets its afternoon 3 s after its own start (5.8 s in the
  trace: sun 21 degrees at 222, its clouds and fog) and again 20, 40 and 60 s later; its
  `M.Start` calls `M.ApplySettings()` through the table, so a wrapper installed before then sees every
  call.

## R16: where the package's binaries come from (2026-11-04, Claude)

The survey behind [ADR 0106](decisions/0106-the-rtx-package-built-on-github.md) (full notes:
`out/r16/binary-sources.md` in the main checkout). `packages/` indexes 54 native binaries: 41 in the
runtime (1.03 GB), 5 in the fixes, 5 of the Model Hotloader, one each of ReShade, the glass and the
material editor.

- **RTX fixes module** (5,491,712 bytes, `447b9dde...`): built from the fixes fork's unpushed commit
  `913bb6b` (`claude/r13-maps`, 23 local commits above the pushed `f28bd5a9`). The four GPL patches in
  `packages/fixes/licenses/oversized-skinning` (`oversized-hw-skinning.patch`, `memory-limits/`,
  `backrooms/`, `autopbr/`), applied to the index of public `f28bd5a9` with
  `--include=source/* --include=premake5.lua --include=public/*` (their `README.md` hunks do not apply),
  give `913bb6b`'s `source/`, `premake5.lua` and `public/` exactly. Built with premake 5.0.0-beta2 (5.0.0
  is incompatible with garrysmod_common `a854f237`) and MSBuild `ReleaseWithSymbols`/x64: garrysmod_common's
  configuration with optimisation off, which is what ships. The fork's `.gitmodules` points
  `source/debug` at the private debug module's repository, so a recursive checkout needs a token;
  `premake5.lua` builds the debug project only when `source/debug/premake_project.lua` exists.
- **RTX Water module** (274,944 bytes): byte-identical to the fixes checkout's
  `x86_64\Release\gmcl_rtxwater_win64.dll` of 2026-10-26 16:41; native Version 4, first committed in
  `b5c194ec` 10 minutes later. The base `f28bd5a9` has Version 5 (`SetCameraInWater`; only `rtxwater.cpp`
  differs), which the packaged Lua would detect and use: a behaviour change.
- **Debug module**: the complete source copy in `packages/fixes/licenses/rtxdebug/checkout` builds it;
  under a path with `!` the pinned generator writes a wrong absolute IntDir (build the helper libraries,
  then the module with `BuildProjectReferences=false -p:IntDir=obj\Release\`).
- **Material editor bridge** (316,416 bytes, `aeb5de42...`): byte-identical to a local build of the
  private repository's `native/rtx_bridge` at `8ece1415` (CMake, Visual Studio 17 2022, Release). Its
  writer test fails once `%TEMP%` is longer than about 75 characters (74 passes, 78 fails, measured with
  the R16 build): the test's game root lives under `%TEMP%`, and the material with every texture role
  then passes MAX_PATH in the bridge (`aperture152Apply.ok` false, `writer_tests.cpp:1097`). A real game
  root of up to about 115 characters is safe by the same measure.
- **`stdshader_dx6.dll`** (437,248 bytes, `4bf218db...`, Obsoletium 1.3.2.1081, linked 2026-08-11):
  built by sambow23 from source that was never pushed (sambow23/obsolete-source-engine was last pushed
  2026-03-21); the binary is committed in Xenthio/garrys-mod-rtx-remixed `74d9f3b6` and SheepyLord's fork
  `d958da61`. Valve's Source 1 SDK licence.
- **Model Hotloader natives**: byte-identical to the build in `ipg\!GMHLVK\wt-full-textures-props`
  (branch `feat/gravity-buoyancy-settings` at the pushed `ecd7c426`) of 2026-10-26, whose 41 staged,
  uncommitted changes hold `SetSecondaryWater`, `SetSecondaryBuoyancy` and `secondaryGravity`, which the
  shipped DLL exports and the packaged Lua uses; no commit has them. The add-on's `native_policy.lua` and
  `mmdhl-native-release.json` pin the four natives' and `lib_coacd.dll`'s SHA-256, so a rebuild needs
  new records there too. `lib_coacd.dll` (`a32e801d...`) is the file in CoACD 1.0.14's PyPI wheel
  `coacd-1.0.14-cp39-abi3-win_amd64.whl` (`6b548f44...`), as the hotloader's `scripts/bootstrap.py`
  takes it.
- **Runtime**: the fork's `_output` (`meson install --tags output`) holds all 189 files the runtime part
  ships under `files/` (except `files/atmosphere/`) and nothing else besides symbols: `d3d9.dll` and the
  two Remix USD plugins compiled, 38 vendor binaries brought by packman, submodules and clones. A full
  local build is 8.9 GB (`_CompRelease_x64`) plus 1.07 GB of `_output`. `meson setup` runs
  `scripts-common/update-deps.cmd`, which pulls every dependency of `packman-external.xml` into
  `PM_PACKAGES_ROOT`. The build finds `vulkan-1.lib` and the Vulkan headers in the fork's own `lib` and
  `include`, and glslang, slang and spirv-val in packman's `external/`.
- **GitHub runners**: `windows-2022` has Visual Studio Enterprise 2022 17.14 (MSVC folder 14.44.35207),
  Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0, CMake 3.31, Ninja 1.13, Python 3.12, Git LFS, `core.autocrlf true` in the
  system git config, no Vulkan SDK and no premake. A private repository's standard runner has 2 cores,
  8 GB and about 14 GB of SSD for the workspace.
- **The first runs on GitHub** (2026-11-05, runs 41962240202 and 41962824677): the `windows-2022`
  runner of this private repository had 2 processors and 8 GB, **81 GB free on C:** and 72.9 GB free on
  D: (the workspace), git 2.56.0, PowerShell 7 (pwsh) for `shell: pwsh` steps. The fork's clone, its
  worktree with the 30 patches, its submodules and the DLSS and SHARC clones took about 90 s and 2.6 GB
  with `--filter=blob:none`.
- **PowerShell 7.5 keeps an empty environment variable.** PowerShell passes `$null` to a .NET `string`
  parameter as `""`; Windows PowerShell 5.1 (.NET Framework) deletes a variable set to `""`, .NET 9 keeps
  it empty. `runtime/build_runtime.ps1` restored `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY` that way after its scratch index,
  and every later git call failed with "gitfile does not point to a valid repository" (git checks that
  variable's folder before a worktree's own). Remove unset variables with `Remove-Item Env:NAME`.
- **`git restore --source=<commit>` in a blob-filtered clone** did not fetch the blobs it needed ("unable
  to read sha1 file of source/rtx_water/rtxwater.cpp"); `git checkout <commit>` (whole commits) does fetch
  them in batches. The fixes are cloned whole in CI (about 300 MB).
- The RTX fixes module built on the runner is 5,492,224 bytes (512 more than this machine's build: the
  runner's `cl` is 19.44.35229, this machine's 19.44.35228, and the paths differ).
- **The Model Hotloader's native source** (ADR 0107): `ipg\!GMHLVK\wt-full-textures-props` is at the
  public `ecd7c426` with 41 changes staged (34 modified, 7 added) and none unstaged; no file the native
  build reads is newer than the shipped `gmcl_mmdhl_win64.dll` (2026-10-26 16:21:10 -0700). Its CMake
  build reads `CMakeLists.txt`, `native/`, `shaders/vulkan/solver.comp` (compiled to SPIR-V by the pinned
  glslang) and every C++ test source (the test targets are declared unconditionally); ICU is for Linux
  only. The build identity is `git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD` of the source folder plus the UTC configure
  time (`CMakeLists.txt:13-20`). `scripts/native_manifest.py` asks `mmdhl_worker.exe --version` for the
  release and build, hashes the five native files of the bin folder and rewrites that release's entry of
  `native_policy.lua`; the part's installation override (`overrides/installation.lua`) accepts installed
  natives only by that entry's size and SHA-256. It imports `compatibility_profiles.py` beside it, so it
  must run without `python -I` (isolated mode leaves the script's folder off `sys.path`).
- A build from the copied source with the worktree's fetched dependencies took 5 minutes on 8 jobs:
  client, server and worker are the shipped sizes, the runtime 512 bytes larger.

## R17: clouds and the sun (2026-11-05, Claude)

### What Numos had before R17 (PoC, `gm_construct`, `out/r17/base1`)

- **One cloud layer, too thin to shade.** Every weather preset (`rtx_weather.h`,
  `WEATHER_PRESET_VALUES_*`) set the one low layer only: `cloudDensity` 0.4 to 3 against the option's
  default 4. The layer's base, cell size and edge detail were not preset fields (`cloudAltitude` 1.3 km,
  `cloudCellSizeKm` 2, `cloudDetailStrength` 0 for every weather), and the second deck was off. A
  sweep on partly cloudy (`out/r17/ab-density`): density 6 with detail 0.8, base 0.9 km, depth 1.6 km,
  type 0.85 and cells of 1.2 km reads as fair-weather cumulus with shaded undersides.
- **Overcast never closed.** The cloud body (NVDF) bakes at `nvdfNominalCoverage`, 0.65 by default (0
  would track the weather in 0.25 steps), and the live cover only moves its surface by
  `(cover - nominal) * nvdfCoverageOffsetKm` = 0.2 km per unit (`cloud_nubis3_common.slangh` step 4):
  cover 1 grows the bodies by 70 m. A column exists where the placement field F clears 1 - cover:
  `presence = saturate((F - (1 - cover)) / cloudColumnFeather)` (`computeCloudColumn`,
  `atmosphere_common.slangh`), so baked at 0.65 only F > 0.35 has cloud; the fork's overcast preset
  had cover 0.64 and rain 0.95, with km-wide gaps either way.
- **The presets dim the sun under cloud** rather than relying on the clouds' shadow: `sunIlluminance`
  20 when clear, (9, 9, 9.5) overcast, (2.5, 2.8, 3.4) in rain, (17, 16, 14) hazy; the hazy preset also
  lowers the Rayleigh coefficients and raises the aerosol (1.9) for its grey-brown sky.
- **No sun disc** outside an eclipse (`evalSolarEclipse`, patch 0004, is the only disc): the sun was the
  Mie aureole of the sky-view LUT, g = 0.8, which keeps half its peak 10 degrees out.
- **Twilight:** the sky LUT is faded out by `smoothstep(-0.09, 0, sun.y)` (gone 5.2 degrees down; the
  fork's note: its multiscattering leaves a residual glow at night), and the night-sky image (stars,
  galaxy band, nebula) fades in by `smoothstep(0.02, 0.15, -sun.y)` (full 8.6 degrees down).
- **The echo deck** shares the low layer's body field: its cover spread is forced to 0 (a uniform
  sheet) and its extinction pinned to 1.8 times `cloudLayer2DensityScale` (`cloud_march_common.slangh`).
- **The fork's translations:** release builds refuse a `.po` without every msgid of `remix.pot`, and
  `update_strings.py` also brought in three option descriptions of earlier patches (the memory census
  request, adaptive emission's enable and scale) that `remix.pot` had missed.

### What the research found (sources)

- **Heights** (WMO International Cloud Atlas, levels): low 0-2 km, middle 2-7 km, high 5-13 km in
  temperate latitudes; Met Office bases: Ac 2.1-5.5 km, As 2-6, Ns 0.6-3, Sc 0.37-2, St 0-0.37, Cu
  0.37-2, Cb 0.34-2 with its top through the troposphere.
- **Cirrus** (Sassen and Campbell 2001, ten years of lidar in Utah): base 8.8 km, top 11.2 km on
  average; optical depth mean 0.75, median 0.61. Cirrocumulus elements are under 1 degree wide (WMO),
  under 120 m overhead at 7 km, and without shading; cirrostratus is a transparent veil "often
  producing halo phenomena"; altostratus shows the sun "as through ground glass" and no halo;
  nimbostratus is "thick enough throughout to blot out the Sun".
- **Optics** (Kokhanovsky 2004): water cloud extinction 0.005-0.1 per m, single-scattering albedo about
  1, asymmetry g about 0.85 for droplets and 0.75 for ice; stratocumulus optical depth 7-23.
- **Real-time practice:** Horizon Zero Dawn (Schneider and Vos 2015) marches the low layer (64-128
  samples, about 2 ms on PS4) and draws "alto and cirro clouds above 4,000 m as 2D scrolling
  textures"; Frostbite (Hillaire 2016) uses a two-lobe Henyey-Greenstein phase (g 0.8 and -0.5) and an
  energy-conserving step integral; Hillaire 2020 notes clouds without multiple scattering "look like
  dark smoke".
- **The sun:** radius 0.2665 degrees at 1 AU (NASA); limb darkening at 550 nm I/I0 = 0.30 + 0.93 mu -
  0.23 mu^2 (Allen, the edge 30 % of the centre), or mu^a with a = 0.41/0.51/0.64 at 680/550/440 nm
  (Hestroffer and Magnan 1998); its colour is the transmittance along its ray (Bruneton, Hillaire); the
  real narrow aureole is about 1 % of the disc's radiance at the limb (Buie 2003), so engines draw the
  disc at its true size and leave glare to bloom.

### Measured in R17 (PoC, `gm_construct`, evidence in `out/r17`)

- **Frame time at 1600x900 does not move.** Every view of every weather and hour took 7.3-7.8 ms
  (`r17c`, 54 views; 1 s averages of `RealFrameTime` before each shot). The game is CPU-bound there
  (`fps_max` 300, no frame limiter, Reflex low latency only), so the sky's GPU cost hides in headroom.
- **At 3840x2160 the GPU binds.** Means over one second, about 100-120 frames each, roughly 0.2 ms
  noise; each A/B in one session (`perf-new`), the published runtime in another (`perf-old`):

  | Weather, view | R17 | R17 without the high layer | R17 without the middle deck | before R17 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | partly cloudy 15 h, sun / away / high | 8.89 / 10.00 / 8.80 | 8.66 / 10.16 / 8.80 | 8.53 / 9.40 / 8.73 | 8.51 / 9.34 / 8.58 |
  | hazy 11 h, sun / away / high | 8.03 / 8.84 / 8.32 | 7.96 / 8.85 / 7.80 | (none) | 8.42 / 9.45 / 10.73 |
  | overcast 14.5 h, sun / away / high | 8.47 / 10.47 / 8.83 | (none) | 8.25 / 9.28 / 8.58 | 8.61 / 9.49 / 8.68 |

  The 2D high layer costs nothing measurable, and up to 0.5 ms where the veil fills the view. The
  middle deck's march costs 0.3-1.2 ms where it is drawn, most toward the horizon; it is skipped
  where the low layer is opaque (transmittance under 0.01) and, since R17, where its cover is 0. The
  overcast row is from before its deck was thickened to 1.8 km.
- **The sun disc's size on screen:** 0.545 degrees is about 11 pixels across at 1600 pixels and 80
  degrees of horizontal field; no ringing next to it in the upscaled shots (`r17b-sun.png`).
- **Cloud cover against the bake cover** (`r17b`, `r17c`, `r17d`):
  - Baked at 0.65 (the old pin), cover 0.92-1 left km-wide gaps.
  - Baked at 1, rain and snow (decks of 2.5-3.5 km) closed. Overcast, drizzle and fog (1, 0.8, 0.5 km)
    kept blue holes, because the noise erosion carves through a slab thinner than about twice
    `nvdfProfileDepthKm` (0.6 km).
  - Baked at 1.35-1.6, every column is present; the decks are thickened to 1.2-1.8 km in this model,
    which is optically thinner than real cloud.
- **The hazy veil and colour:** with the cirrostratus veil, the hazy sky away from the sun measured
  (132, 130, 126) in sRGB against (111, 131, 150) without it: the same brightness, desaturated and warm.
  Composited over only the third of the skylight made above 9 km, with its own light dimmed by the
  air in front of it only, it measured (135, 136, 137): neutral and milky.
- **Twilight on the presets' date** (sun elevation by hour): 18.9 h 5.3 degrees, 19.35 h 0.7, 19.5 h
  -0.8, 19.8 h -3.6, 20.4 h -9.1, 21.0 h -14.0. Before R17 the nebula of the night-sky image was
  already plain at -3.6 degrees. It now starts at 8 degrees down and is full at 17.5 (`deepNight` in
  `evalStarMap`); the single stars keep their fade.
- **The runtime grew** from 397,908,992 to about 414,400,000 bytes. The geometry resolver and the
  indirect integrator, which include `atmosphere_sky.slangh`, compile in many permutations, and each
  carries the high layer.
- **Translations:** 42 entries in each of the six catalogs: the R17 menu text and option descriptions,
  and the three earlier option descriptions `remix.pot` had missed.
  - The first answer from the translator wrote every non-ASCII character as `?`, and its own check
    (keys, empties, printf) passed anyway.
  - The check now also requires the script of each language. The files are written as ASCII JSON with
    `\u` escapes.

## R18: thin decks, the middle deck, ice halos, haze and twilight (2026-11-05, Claude)

### Why thin decks broke up (R17's runtime, `out/r18/e1`, options set live)

- **The profile depth.** `cloud_nubis3_common.slangh` step 7: `profile = saturate(-sdfLive /
  nvdfProfileDepthKm)`, then `valueErosion(profile, erosion)` with the wispy edge cut
  `nubis3EdgeErosion * 1.5 * wispy^2 * (1 - profile)` (2.28 by default). A deck's middle is at most half
  its depth from the surface, so at the default 0.6 km anything under about 1.2 km never reaches profile
  1. Overcast at 0.9 km: km-wide gaps at 0.6, closed at 0.25 km (`e1`, `thin06` and `thin025`).
- **The shape displacement.** Step 6e pushes and pulls the body surface by `wobbleMid *
  nubis3ShapeVarietyKm` (1.11 km by default, wobbleMid in [-0.5, 0.5] for wispy types) at 2.4 km
  wavelengths. On a 0.6 km drizzle deck it still cut smooth km-wide holes with the profile at 0.18 km and
  every column whole (bake cover 2; `e3`, `drizzle-13.0-high`). R18 scales it by
  `saturate((nvdfProfileDepthKm - 0.1) / 0.5)`: all of it for the cumulus weathers (0.6), 30 % for
  overcast, 16 % for drizzle, 10 % for fog.
- **Columns:** with the bake cover above 1 (`computeCloudColumn`), presence is
  `saturate((F + cover - 1 + carve) / 0.35)` with the body carve `carve` up to +-0.375; at 1.5 a few
  columns still fall to presence 0.36 (top at about a third of the slab). At 2 every column is whole.

### The middle deck before R18

- `marchEchoDeck` read layer 1's body field (`AtmosphereCloudNvdfSdf`) at the deck's height through
  `samplePos + (31.7, 0, -17.3) * cloudLayer2NoiseSeed`, its cover spread forced to 0. So its cloudlets
  were layer 1's bodies at layer 1's bake cover and cell size (1.3 km in partly cloudy, about 18 degrees
  overhead at 4.2 km), and it was closed wherever layer 1 baked a closed deck. Its cover only moved the
  surface by `(cover - nominal) * 0.2 km`.
- WMO: altocumulus elements are 1-5 degrees wide seen more than 30 degrees above the horizon
  (cirrocumulus under 1, stratocumulus over 5), in patches, sheets or layers, often in rows.

### Ice halos (plate and column crystals; geometry `out/r18/halo_geometry.py`)

- Ice's refractive index: 1.3072 (656 nm), 1.3104 (about 550 nm), 1.3160 (450 nm).
- **22 degree halo** (60 degree prism, random columns): minimum deviation 21.63 / 21.87 / 22.30 degrees.
  **46 degree halo** (90 degree prism): 45.14 / 45.82 / 47.04, much fainter and rarer.
- **Parhelia** (plates falling level, 60 degree prism, light at elevation e): the light's projection on
  the horizontal plane meets an effective index n' = sqrt(n^2 - sin^2 e) / cos e (Bravais), and the sun
  dog sits at the light's height at an azimuth of 2 asin(n' / 2) - 60 degrees from it:

  | Sun elevation | Azimuth from the sun (green) | Angle from the sun | Circumzenithal arc elevation (green) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 0 | 21.9 | 21.9 | 57.9 (none: too faint) |
  | 10 | 22.5 | 22.2 | 59.8 |
  | 20 | 24.6 | 23.1 | 66.0 (46.0 above the sun) |
  | 30 | 28.8 | 24.8 | 79.6 |
  | 50 | 51.6 | 32.5 | none |

  They vanish above 60.7 degrees (n' = 2); red 60.9, blue 60.4.
- **Circumzenithal arc** (plates, light in through the top face, out through a side face, a 90 degree
  prism): elevation asin(sqrt(n^2 - cos^2 e)), none above 32.1 degrees (green; red 32.7, blue 31.2),
  brightest at a sun of about 20 degrees; red toward the sun.
- In R18's shots (`out/r18/e2`, `e3`, hazy at 17.5 h, sun at 20.3 degrees, and 18.3 h, 11.6 degrees):
  the sun dogs sit just outside the 22 degree halo with a red inner edge and a white tail, and the arc
  is an upside-down rainbow above, red at its lower edge.

### Haze

- The runtime's aerosol: `mieScattering` 3.996e-3 and `mieAbsorption` 4.4e-3 per km (Hillaire 2020,
  Table 1), a single-scattering albedo of 0.48, both times `aerosolDensity`; `mieAnisotropy` 0.97 (the
  option's default; Hillaire's is 0.8). R17's hazy had aerosol 1.9, air (7, 11, 20)e-3 and a sun of (17,
  16, 14): a dark grey-brown sky (`out/r17/final`, `hazy-11.0`).
- Haze is "an opalescent appearance" of dry particles (WMO). Water-soluble and sulfate aerosol scatter
  about nine tenths of what they meet (albedo about 0.9-0.95); soot absorbs.
- `out/r18/e1`, hazy at 11 h with aerosol 2.6, `mieAbsorption` 0.5e-3 (0.11 of the default) and the
  clear sky's air and sun: g 0.97 gave a bluer sky, 0.8 a milkier one, 0.7 about the same as 0.8.
- **The aerosol is optically thin in this model:** `mieScattering` 3.996e-3 per km over a scale height
  of 1.2 km (`kMieScaleHeight`) is a vertical optical depth of 0.0048 per unit of `aerosolDensity`, about
  0.014 at hazy's 3 (real haze: 0.3-1). `out/r18/e5`: 10 and 25 made the sky only a little whiter
  overhead (sRGB away from the sun (131, 139, 148) at 3, (143, 146, 149) at 25), so hazy keeps 3.
- **Auto-exposure evens out the brightness:** in the same view, R17's hazy sky measured (118, 119,
  120) away from the sun and R18's (113, 121, 131): the change on screen is the colour, from a neutral
  grey to a pale bluish white. R17's darker look came from the sun-facing views, where the bright halo
  sets the exposure.

### Twilight

- `evalSkyRadiance` multiplied the sky LUT by `smoothstep(-0.09, 0, sun.y)`: half at 2.6 degrees down,
  black at 5.2. With R18's fade at 18 degrees (`e2`, `fade18`), the LUT's own sky at 12.4 and 15.5
  degrees down is black (no glow, no blobs): its twilight falls by orders of magnitude by then.
- With the LUT kept whole to 8 degrees down and faded out by 16 (`e3`): at 4.1 degrees down a purple sky
  over an orange band; at 6.3 a deep blue with an orange glow over the sunset; at 7.8 and 9.1 the glow
  only; at 10.8 night, the galaxy fading in.

### Cost at 3840x2160 (`out/r18/perf-new`, `perf-old`)

Means over about a second (76-95 frames) before each shot, the same spawn and views in both sessions
(`perf-framing.jpg`), about 0.2 ms of noise. The R17 column is the published R17 package in a second
session with the same states; the "R18, feature off" column switches one R18 feature off in the R18
session (the middle deck's cover to 0 in partly cloudy, `cirrusArcStrength` 0 in hazy at 17.5 h).

| Weather, view | R18 | R18, feature off | R17 |
|---|---|---|---|
| partly cloudy 15 h, sun / away / high | 11.30 / 11.97 / 11.26 | 11.01 / 11.78 / 11.11 (no middle deck) | 11.40 / 12.01 / 11.57 |
| overcast 14.5 h, sun / away / high | 11.45 / 13.31 / 12.03 | | 11.56 / 12.29 / 12.10 |
| drizzle 13 h, sun / away / high | 11.65 / 11.90 / 11.63 | | 11.85 / 12.31 / 12.31 |
| foggy 10 h, sun / away / high | 11.87 / 11.88 / 11.16 | | 11.62 / 12.00 / 11.31 |
| hazy 11 h, sun / away / high | 11.13 / 11.44 / 11.18 | | 11.61 / 11.66 / 11.48 |
| hazy 17.5 h, arcs / sun | 11.26 / 11.13 | 11.15 / 11.27 (no halos of plates) | 11.28 / 11.75 |

- **On average R18 costs what R17 did:** 11.62 ms over these 17 views against 11.77.
- **The middle deck:** 0.15-0.3 ms where drawn, as R17's (0-0.33 ms in the R17 session).
- **The sun dogs and the arc:** within the noise (+0.11 and -0.14 ms).
- **Overcast toward the horizon costs 1 ms more** (13.31 against 12.29 ms; the views toward the sun and
  overhead are the same). The march takes as many steps across the 0.9 km deck as across R17's 1.8 km
  one, so a grazing ray meets twice as many dense samples, each one lit, before it turns opaque.
- **Memory:** no texture, buffer or grid is added; `AtmosphereArgs` (also inside the ray-tracing,
  composite and debug-view constants) grows by one 16-byte row. The DLL grew from 414,372,864 to
  417,072,128 bytes, the shaders that include the sky (many permutations).
- The frame times are about 2.5 ms higher than R17's own 4K table (8.5-10.5 ms), for both runtimes
  alike: another day's machine state; the comparison holds within the session pair.

## R19: the pre-release review's fixes (2026-11-05, Claude and seven Claude subagents)

The verified review is [R19-review.md](handover/R19-review.md); each part's report holds its full evidence.

- **Steam's `subscribedby`** (`WorkshopItemDetails` in `appworkshop_4000.acf`): comma-separated decimal
  account ids. This library: 817 items installed and in the details; 777 have `subscribedby` (744 with
  three ids, 22 with four, 10 with one, 1 with two); 40 have none, holding `manifest`, `timeupdated`,
  `timetouched`, `latest_*` and sometimes `ugchandle`: what `steamworks.DownloadUGC` leaves (M6 measured
  that it installs an item without a subscription; ADR 0015). None of the 40 holds a native package.
- **GMod's Lua clock.** `bin\win64\lua_shared.dll` imports only `tier0.dll`, `vstdlib.dll` and
  `KERNEL32.dll`, so it links the C runtime statically: LuaJIT's `os.clock()` counts from when that DLL
  loads, after the loader's start-up, not from the process start. The UCRT's `clock()` is QPC wall time
  since its CRT's initialization (Windows SDK 10.0.26100 `ucrt\time\clock.cpp`). So the render guard
  cannot date a status report from Lua; it uses a marker file held for the life of the game process.
- **A file held with `FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE` and read sharing only:** `GetFileAttributesW`,
  `FindFirstFileW`, `std::filesystem::exists` and Python's `os.stat` see it; another `DeleteFileW` fails
  with a sharing violation, a second `CREATE_ALWAYS` fails; it is gone moments after the holding process
  is killed (`test_status.cpp`, `activation_integration.py`).
- **System32 `winmm.dll`'s imports** (10.0.26100.1): statically only `ntdll.dll` and API sets; WINMMBASE,
  the `api-ms-win-mm-*` sets, AudioSes, the `ext-ms-win-ntuser-*` sets, OLEAUT32 and the COM sets are
  delay-loaded. So the proxy's load of it under the loader lock waits on no other thread (review F-08).
- **The fixes' native Lua surface.** `gmcl_RTXFixesBinary` registers `MaterialPipeline`, `RemixMaterial`,
  `RemixLight`, `RemixConfig` and `RTXWaterNative` in the real `_G`, so any server's client Lua calls them.
  Source's `IFileSystem::Open` opens an absolute or UNC path as given, whatever the path ID; before R19 the
  VTF reader (`vtf_parser.cpp:232` at `913bb6b`), ToPBR's `ParseVMTFile` (`to_pbr.cpp:1855-1859`) and
  `ReadVMTShaderName` (`auto_categorisation.cpp:312`) fell back to the bare name.
  `RemixConfig.SetConfigVariable` writes any option to the User layer; the path-valued ones are the
  atmosphere textures (`rtx_atmosphere.cpp:880-883`), `rtx.cameraSequence.filePath`
  (`rtx_camera.cpp:1159-1176`), NRC's CUDA DLL folder (`rtx_nrc_context.cpp:251-256`) and Nsight's paths.
- **The patched fixes' trees.** Replaying `build_modules.ps1`'s index steps, the four pre-R19 patches on
  `f28bd5a` give exactly `913bb6b`'s object ids (`source` `aa6ed7d1`, `public` `7165af4d`, `premake5.lua`
  `b308ed2f`); RTX Water's `b5c194e` `source/rtx_water` is `b3547296`. `pins.json` now records the
  patched ids, so the check holds without a pushed commit.
- **The material editor's bridge** resolved a texture source (`std::filesystem::canonical`) before its
  root check, so a UNC source contacted its host first (the same class as ToPBR's folder); its writer test
  needs `%TEMP%` of at most about 75 characters (76 fails at `writer_tests.cpp:1152`, 50 passes; R16
  found the same limit). GMod's duplicator calls entity modifiers without `pcall`, so one modifier's error
  stops the rest of a paste.
- **The Model Hotloader's dependencies** fetched with `git fetch --depth 1 <repo> <sha>` and `git archive`
  (with `core.autocrlf=false`, `core.eol=lf`) are byte-identical to GitHub's codeload archives of the same
  commits (R16's vendor folder); with Git for Windows' default `core.autocrlf=true`, `git archive` writes
  CRLF. `sv_commands.lua`'s main chunk holds 196 locals (LuaJIT refuses past 200).
- **Glass map imports.** vbsp gives each leaf its own range of the leaf-brush lump (gm_construct: 5,002
  leaves whose ranges sum to exactly its 6,386 references; gm_flatgrass 3,610 and 2,855; none shared), so a
  world walk visits each reference at most once. The walk costs 5.5 ms per 8,388,480 references, so the
  former unbounded 2^36 was about 45 s on the import worker. A crafted 99 KiB map of 7,000 brushes sharing
  one prism parses and cooks in 6.0 s; with R19's cancellation the destructor returns 0.75 ms after its
  stop request. gm_construct with the R19 reader: parse 13.8 ms, asynchronous total 64.8 ms. A near-cap
  pane snapshot is 5,686 bytes in the engine harness.
- **GLI** (`include/gli`): `gli::load` tries a file as DDS, then KMG, then KTX, whatever its name, and the
  KMG and KTX readers copy what their headers claim; GLI's texture cache keeps 16 levels in fixed arrays
  (`texture.hpp:289-290`); `GLI_ASSERT` and the runtime's `assert` are empty in release builds;
  `block_size(FORMAT_INVALID)` reads before the format table. The texture manager makes every replacement
  texture a 2D image at the extent of its first loaded mip, so a side past the GPU's limit fails only when
  the larger mips stream in (an open item).
- **Runtime build time.** A change to `rtx_option.h` recompiles 251 objects in about 2 minutes with 4 jobs.
  The fork's `.gitignore` ignores `tests/rtx/unit/*` except a few names: new test sources need `git add -f`.
- **GitHub Actions storage.** About 1.2 GB of the 2 GB was in use with one package artifact (about 0.84 GB),
  so the package workflow keeps deleting the older package before uploading its own (review F-07).

## R20-D native follow-up and completed canvas/filter measurements (2026-11-06)

The initial camera-family assumption is corrected by native evidence in
[ADR 0122](decisions/0122-raster-canvases-keep-their-native-draws.md). End and End3D are separate
C functions sharing the 3D counter; End2D, End3D2D and EndOrthoView have their own counters.
Generic Start tests the type string's first byte. Native function dossiers, addresses, client.dll
SHA-256 and limitations are retained in the [report](handover/R20-D-report.md) and its exported
REA bundle under out/r20d. The guard now uses mode-specific cleanup, including generic 2D starts.

Live DX7 materials report UnlitGeneric_DX6 and individual boolean GetInt queries return nil;
packed $flags supplies vertex color 16, vertex alpha 32, additive 128, decal 65536 and translucent
2097152. The observer normalizes the fallback suffix and reads those bits. In 10-comparison,
legacyEffectTexturesForSession changed from empty to populated without material mutation.

Physics Blood cl_render.lua:126-136 uses the premultiplied transmission pair DST_COLOR /
ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA. The old InstanceManager translation fell through to blendEnabled=false,
explaining black rectangular backgrounds despite corrected colors. Patch 0035 selects a private
legacy blend value 11 and evaluates clamp(alpha - luminance(color), 0, 1) in the shared evaluator.
The 11-filter capture removes the rectangles. Its float-canvas alpha result is 205, equal to native;
10-comparison/before returned 255. test_gmod_effects independently compares sixteen coverage /
transmission combinations to the native destination factor; authored MDL blend values stay 0..10.

The PoC matches its original cached depot manifests exactly: 7,279,873,012 verified bytes and zero
missing/size/hash/reparse/unverified entries (10-comparison/stock-verification.json). It predates
the field's current manifests, whose comparison yields 46 differences. No depot file was rewritten.

R20-D preview follow-up: the camera fix removed native errors but left lit raster thumbnails black.
Lighting-mode/depth experiments did not restore them; an UnlitGeneric base-map studio override
was verified live. Stock helpers reset suppression between draws, so callback-local preview intent
must survive that reset. Native Material lookups can produce transient Lua wrappers: weak-key cache
misses consumed 256 material names during outline passes. Stable name/texture keys survived 129
live draws with eight identities and 300 synthetic draws without budget exhaustion. The accepted
colored JPEG is in out/r20d/21-preview; entity submaterials never change. Only the representative
map is now looked up, avoiding unused skins. The remaining multi-material preview approximation
is documented, rather than altering game shaders or persistent materials.

## R20-T: a toolgun HUD draw can enter the lit scene (2026-11-06)

- `companion/nativeloader/lua/autorun/client/nativeloader_toolgun.lua:9` created an opaque
  UnlitGeneric material with only `$nocull` (live `$flags=8192`), leaving depth enabled. Calling
  `surface.DrawPoly` in HUDPaint is not by itself enough to make this the raster HUD. The packaged
  runtime source, `src/d3d9/d3d9_rtx.cpp:574-583` (R20 build `3cb32fb8`), recognizes orthographic
  draws as UI only when Z writes are off; its post-injection path at lines 621-636 rasterizes later
  draws. Thus earlier HUD elements can hide the material's mistake. This predates patch 0034's
  offscreen-target early return; no runtime change is required for the HUD material to comply.
- In the locked PoC, loader 0.15.0 and the main package reproduce the nearly black display at
  **3840x2160**, fixed **21:00**, actual ready **DLSS/DLSS-G 1/1**. The same texture in the
  add-on's ordinary corner preview is bright. Enabling that preview also immediately makes the
  companion's toolgun redraw bright/sharp; disabling it returns the dim, temporally smeared screen.
  Evidence: `out/r20t/depth/loader015-4k/game/shot-03-before_night_inspect.png` through
  `shot-05-night_disable_mirror.png`. Capture/draw counters continued to advance in both states.
- Substituting an otherwise identical private material created with `$ignorez=1` fixes the
  screen without the preview, including with the add-on's 3D inspect overlay disabled:
  `shot-07-night_hud_ignorez.png` and `shot-08-night_hud_ignorez_no_inspect_overlay.png` beside
  those captures. The same controlled comparison passes with the actual release loader 0.14.0
  (`out/r20t/depth/loader014-4k/`). A magenta polygon probe in `out/r20t/before/` independently
  confirms the projected screen geometry is in the correct place; the RT content is not dark.
- `$ignorez` is Source's material flag bit 15 (32768), alongside `$nocull` bit 13 (8192):
  [Valve's IMaterial flags](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/src/public/materialsystem/imaterial.h).
  The fix remains in this private HUD material, preserving the screen renderer's pixels and the
  existing 2D redraw design. No persistent category, exposure adjustment or native binary changes.
- The validated pre-R20 comparison (`out/r20t/followups/v014-complete/`) repeats that dependence
  with the distributed v0.14.0 runtime `b311f0d9...`, old companion Lua and standalone DTS. Two
  missing CI-built modules were recovered from v0.14.0's own indexed inputs; exact substitutions
  and validation are recorded in `v014-completion.json`, rather than claiming full old archive
  identity. `git blame` dates the missing private-material flag to `6c45603` (2026-10-30).
- Corrected-probe captures with release loader 0.14.0 and loader 0.15.0 keep the screen bright
  with its production HUD hook deliberately first, and after another UI draw. Static RT colours
  match at noon/night; the sampled white panel is RGB 255 in both RT and displayed screen, or
  128 with the add-on's own half backlight. Three blue/white/green patches are measured in
  `out/r20t/pixel-measurements.json` (maximum RT-to-screen filtered-channel difference 3.8).

## After R20: what two MSVC links of the same sources differ in (2026-11-06)

Measured for [ADR 0126](decisions/0126-a-record-of-what-this-repositorys-modules-were-built-from.md)
with the Release preset, MSVC 19.44.35228.0, Ninja 1.12.1 (VS 2022 Build Tools):

- **The PDB path's length moves the data after it.** The CodeView record (`RSDS`, the PDB's GUID, age
  and absolute path) lies in the middle of `.rdata`, before the VC_FEATURE and POGO debug data and other
  constants. The glass module built in `.claude\worktrees\heuristic-yalow-28cab7` (PDB path 17
  characters longer than the stored module's `out\worktrees\r19-glass`) differed from it in 69,147
  bytes in 4,802 runs: the export directory's address, `.rdata`'s size and RIP-relative displacements
  all through `.text`. The client module against `r20-qa`: 23,929 bytes in 1,483 runs.
- **With a path of the same length** (`out\worktrees\rbv-cl` for `r20-qa`, `rbv-glass` for
  `r19-glass`, both at commit `a5a3ff1`), the client module differed from the stored one only in 32
  bytes: the file header's time stamp, the three debug directory entries' time stamps, the PDB GUID
  (age 1 in both) and the path's characters. The glass module also differed in the PDB age (2 in the
  stored module, linked twice into one PDB; 1 in the new build) and in five 8-character
  anonymous-namespace names in RTTI type names in `.data` (`.?AVBroadLayers@?A0x10cb2338@glass@nl@@`
  against `?A0xe1781ab7`): MSVC derives them from the source file's path. 71 bytes in 11 runs.
- **Neither module contains the loader's version**: `nl::version()` (`loader/core/src/version.cpp`) is
  not linked into the client module, and no `0.15.0` string is in either DLL. The glass module's only
  source change between its build (`baba026d`, R19-G) and `a5a3ff1` was that version in the root
  `CMakeLists.txt`.
- **What Ninja knows of a build**: `ninja -t inputs <dll>` lists the sources of the module and of every
  library it links (with their objects and the phony order targets); `ninja -t deps` lists each object's
  headers from MSVC's `/showIncludes`, without the compiler's and the Windows SDK's. The client module
  read 83 files (all under `loader/client`, `loader/core`, `third_party/gmod`, `third_party/lzma`), the
  glass module 443 (`glass/native`, `third_party/gmod`, `third_party/jolt`, `third_party/lzma`) besides
  the generated headers in the build folder (`bootstrap_data.h`, Jolt's precompiled header). `ninja -n
  <target>` prints `ninja: no work to do.` when the target is current.

## After R20: git pathspecs that leave out the part folders' READMEs (2026-11-06)

Measured for [ADR 0127](decisions/0127-part-folder-readmes-keep-the-release.md) with git 2.56.0.windows.1,
in throwaway repositories under `out\tmp` (a fresh `git init` here sets `core.ignorecase=true`), with the
pathspecs `packages ':(exclude)packages/README.md' ':(exclude,glob)packages/*/README.md'`:

- **`git diff --quiet <base> HEAD`** exits 0 after a commit that changes, adds or deletes only
  `packages/README.md` or `packages/p/README.md`, or adds a folder `packages/n/` holding only a
  `README.md`; it exits 1 for `packages/p/lua/README.md`, `packages/p/sub/q/README.md`,
  `packages/p/licenses/README.md`, `packages/p/LICENSE`, `packages/p/files.json`, and for
  `packages/p/README.md` together with `packages/p/a.lua`.
- **The match is case-sensitive although `core.ignorecase` is true**: replacing `packages/p/README.md`
  by `readme.md` shows `A packages/p/readme.md` (exit 1).
- **`git status --porcelain`** prints nothing for an untracked `packages/README.md`, `packages/p/README.md`
  or new folder holding only a `README.md`; a new folder with any other file, or with only a deeper
  README, prints collapsed (`?? packages/n/`, `?? packages/p/lua/`).
- **Without `glob` magic `*` crosses `/`**: in this repository (1,727 tracked files under `packages/`)
  `:(exclude)packages/*/README.md` leaves out 16 files, the `glob` form exactly 5: `packages/README.md`
  and the READMEs of `blood-overhaul-rtx`, `fixes`, `glass` and `toolgun-screen`.
- **Pathspec variables**: with `GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS=1` the exclusions are literal names that match
  nothing, so a README-only commit exits 1. `GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS=1` keeps the README case at 0 but also
  leaves out `packages/p/readme.md` (exit 0). `GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS=1` or `GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS=1` alone
  change nothing here (the explicit magic decides); both at once are fatal (exit 128: "global 'glob' and
  'noglob' pathspec settings are incompatible"), which `same_inputs()` reads as "git cannot tell".
- **What reads `packages/` directly**: `tools/workshop.json` takes part licences (`fixes`,
  `model-hotloader`, `character-motion-importer`, `toolgun-screen` and `blood-overhaul-rtx` `LICENSE`)
  and folders below `licenses/` (`fixes/licenses/oversized-skinning`, `fixes/licenses/rtxdebug`,
  `model-hotloader/licenses`, two `CREDITS.txt`), all through `--add-to-addon`
  (`package_fixes.add_to_addons`, which `package_content.py` shares), whose folders keep their Markdown
  (`collect(..., docs=True)`); `companion_i18n.extract()` walks `packages/` for
  `.lua` files only. Everything else comes from `out/inputs/<part>/`, which `inputs.unpack` writes from
  each part's index alone.

## R21: Blood Overhaul's materials under RTX, and the Hotloader's check on build 26439081 (2026-11-06)

Measured by [R21-A](handover/R21-A-report.md) and [R21-B](handover/R21-B-report.md) in the PoC (GMod
build 26439081, RTX on); evidence under each task worktree's `out/r21a*`, `out/r21b`.

- **Shader names under the RTX fixes' DX6 path.** `IMaterial:GetShader()` reports the fallback in use:
  the engine's blood subrect resolves to the package's world decal as `LightmappedGeneric_DX6`, or to
  Crunchy's original as `DecalModulate_dx6` when that copy wins. A substring test
  on the lower-cased name (`lightmappedgeneric`, `vertexlitgeneric`) finds the tintable ones.
- **Which copy of a shared material name wins** among legacy add-on folders follows the folder names:
  with Crunchy's files in a folder named `aaa...` and a legacy copy in `bbb...`, Crunchy's modulate VMTs
  won over the package's `nlblood`; named `zzz...`/`yyy...`, the package's alpha VMTs won. Where
  Crunchy's win, engine blood stays visible under RTX with its PBR (the layer also keys Crunchy's
  original texture hashes, with explicit opacity) but keeps its natural colours.
- **Rebinding a texture.** Restoring `$basetexture` with the `ITexture` object saved earlier left the
  engine's own blood decals missing under RTX; `SetTexture` with the texture's name works. Skipping
  `SetTexture` because the current texture already has that name also failed the RTX visual probe: the
  binding calls must be made. Two Lua `IMaterial` objects can wrap one engine material: key snapshots by
  `GetName()`.
- **Restoring every used material and painting it again** on each enabled scheme change was R21-A's
  first design; R20's paint-only path (restore only when the master switch goes off) is what ships.
- **Small droplet stains on a stock white floor plate** do not show in PoC captures with the published
  v0.15.0 package or with R21, though the landing traces and `util.DecalEx` calls are counted (citizen
  floor, cumulative: 64/198/331/454 in R20 across clear epochs). Wall, cube, NPC and engine decals
  render. Cause not established.
- **The Hotloader's game check on build 26439081**: the client's report marks `engine.dll`,
  `client.dll`, `materialsystem.dll` and `shaderapidx9.dll` as unverified with no interface findings;
  the server's `vphysics.dll` matches its profile. Imported characters load and render (53 live draws,
  draw age 0) with the published natives.
- **Size of the complete blood part**: 550 indexed inputs, 272 binaries, 365.2 MB uncompressed, 109.4 MB
  compressed (R20: 261, 112, 138.7 MB, 55.5 MB); the package grows by 226.6 MB to 1,746 files,
  2.18 GB.

## After R21: GPU timeouts around a 4K map load (2026-11-06)

From [R21-C](handover/R21-C-report.md); evidence in the main checkout's `out/field-stuck-20261106/` and
`out/worktrees/r21-device-loss/out/r21c/`.

- A Remix "device lost" here is a Windows GPU timeout: nvlddmkm event 153, twice two seconds apart
  (`\Device\Video3`, "Error occurred on GPUID: 100"), then `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` about five seconds after
  the first; this machine's WER LiveKernelEvent reports are code 141 (video engine timeout). The registry
  has no `TdrDelay`, so Windows' two-second default applies. 74 such events in the 14 days before.
- Remix's GPU-crash prompt (`util_sentry.cpp` `promptGpuCrashConsent`, `MB_YESNO | MB_TOPMOST`, no owner)
  keeps the game on its last frame until answered; a player sees a frozen loading screen.
- `remix-dxvk.log` stays 0 bytes on disk while the game runs and is written at exit (397,703 bytes after
  the prompt was declined in the field).
- The field's timeout came three seconds after the map's first ray-traced frames (NRC activated at
  22:59:42, an Opacity Micromap texel-tap warning at 22:59:44.751, timeout at 22:59:45). The PoC's came
  34 s after start, after the map command, with no acceleration structures or micromaps yet (frame 4110,
  3.7 GB in use).
- `dxvk.enableAftermath = True` logs "Aftermath enabled", but the PoC timeout wrote no `.nv-gpudmp`.
- A fresh install still reads `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA\RTXRemix\user_settings\<hash>.conf` first (the
  user's diagnostics choices): deleting the game's files leaves it in place.

## R22: the first start's unpack, a window beside it, and the hint's switch (2026-11-07)

Measured in the PoC (RTX 5090, 3840x2160 desktop at 200 %, GMod build 26439081) by R22's QA
([report](handover/R22-report.md); evidence in the `r22` worktree's `out/r22/qa*`).

- **A first start unpacks 7.3 GB** from the 2.18 GB package (parts are stored compressed): 2,324 changes,
  131,748 file-system operations, 46.7-48.9 s of `deployment.elapsed_ms` (R21-A's runs 42-62 s). The game's
  own window (`Valve001`) becomes visible about 1.5 s after start-up work ends. An ordinary start: 0.33 s,
  outcome `unchanged`, 34-590 ms of start-up in R21's logs.
- **`MsgWaitForMultipleObjects` and paint input.** With `QS_ALLINPUT`, a pending paint (`QS_PAINT`) makes
  the wait return input at once; a loop that calls `InvalidateRect` on every pass therefore never sleeps,
  and in R22's first build it never saw its event signalled either. Redraw from `WM_TIMER` and test the
  event explicitly (`WaitForSingleObject(event, 0)`) on every pass.
- **The first `ShowWindow` of a process started hidden.** A test runner (CTest) starts the test process
  with a hidden show command, and Windows applies it to the first `ShowWindow` of an ordinary
  (overlapped) window: `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE` left the stand-in game window hidden. `SetWindowPos` with
  `SWP_SHOWWINDOW` is not subject to it. A popup window (the loading window) was not affected.
- **Destroying an active window** activates another top-level window of the process; if that window's
  thread does not pump messages, the destroying thread waits in `DestroyWindow`. A window that is never
  active (`WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`, `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE`) hands nothing over.
- **`poc_session.game_window(pid)`** takes any visible window of the game's process whose title contains
  "Garry's Mod"; the loading window is titled "RTX Remix" so it is never taken for the game's.
- **`cl_showhints` is archived in `garrysmod/cfg/client.vdf`**, not `config.cfg`; Steam Cloud keeps only
  `cfg/config.cfg` for app 4000 (`userdata/<account>/4000/remote/cfg`). The user's field game and the PoC
  both had `"cl_showhints" "0"` (field file dated 2026-11-06 23:18), so ADR 0117's hint never showed there.
- **The loading window at 200 %**: 560 DIP wide is 1,146 x 490 physical pixels with the frame; the
  per-monitor-aware thread draws it crisply while the game's thread stays DPI-unaware.

## R23: what stops a start at "Starting Lua", Wuthering Waves maps, Derma's tab order (2026-11-08)

Measured on this machine (RTX 5090, GMod build 26439081, PoC and field `materialsystem.dll` SHA-256
`6c9075c5...`, identical) by R23 ([report](handover/R23-report.md), [ADR 0130](decisions/0130-an-engine-guard-for-lua-start-up.md);
evidence in the `r23` worktree's `out/r23/`).

- **The ARC9 hang** (first sampled in the field by another session, 2026-11-08): main thread at 100 % CPU,
  about 150,000 `NtCreateFile` a second, the stack holding `@lua/autorun/sh_arc9_autorun.lua`,
  `arc9/shared/sh_csgo_effects.lua` and `materials/particle/warp5_explosion.vmt` probed in every
  `garrysmod/addons/*` folder. [ARC9] Gunsmith Reloaded (2910537020) calls
  `game.AddParticles("particles/csgo_explosions_fx.pcf")`; its `particle/warp5_explosion.vmt` is `Refract` with
  `"<dx90" { "$fallbackmaterial" "particle/warp5_explosion" }`.
- **`CMaterial::InitializeShader`** (`materialsystem.dll` rva 0xf950-0xfc33): the one reference to the string
  `$fallbackmaterial` is the `lea rdx` at 0xfb4c; the call at 0xfb53 goes to `KeyValues::GetString` (0x730d0)
  with the current fallback section in r13 (`mov rcx, r13`); r14 holds the material across the loop (its
  warnings call r14's first virtual, `GetName`). Non-empty, the loop loads that VMT and starts again with
  its shader: no pass counter. Pattern from rva 0xfb42, unique in the image:
  `4C 8D 05 ?? ?? ?? ?? 49 8B CD 48 8D 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 7C 24 40 44 8B 64 24 44 80 38 00 0F 84`.
  The call's displacement (rva 0xfb54) is 4-byte aligned.
- **PoC A/B with the two ARC9 add-ons as folders**: the published package (no guard) stopped at Lua, the
  console's last line `ARC9 Registered 505 attachments.`, the window hung for 300 s and was ended; this
  build loaded gm_construct, quit normally after 95 s, and the guard cut the self-fallback 6 times (once
  per initialisation of the material; the client copy of the module read the count from the server copy).
  The material then uses `UnlitGeneric_DX6`.
- **GMod does not mount a loose `.gma` in `garrysmod/addons`**: with the two GMAs copied there, `ARC9`
  stayed nil and the material was missing. Extract them (`tools/gmapack`) into folders.
- **TFA Base** (2840031720, 43,406,497 bytes, fetched by `steamworks.DownloadUGC` in a PoC session, which reports
  `content/4000/2840031720/gma.gma`, relative to Steam's Workshop folder): 61 VMTs, no `$fallbackmaterial`; it
  starts under RTX with and without the guard (91 s and 52 s sessions, normal quits).
- **The installed Workshop content** (738 items with a `.gma`, 23,820 VMTs, read only): 33 materials have a
  `$fallbackmaterial`; one is a fallback to itself (Gunsmith Reloaded's), none is part of a longer cycle.
- **Lua chunk names on the C stack**: a legacy add-on's stuck autorun shows as
  `@addons/nl_stall_test/lua/autorun/nl_stall_test.lua` (plus fragments of its absolute path); the sampled
  instruction pointer of a JIT-compiled Lua loop lies outside any module. The watchdog's report and message
  came 90 s after the name stopped changing (the message 98.5 s into the session).
- **Derma's `DPropertySheet:SetActiveTab`** (`garrysmod/lua/vgui/dpropertysheet.lua` 212-234) calls
  `OnActiveTabChanged(old, new)` before it sets `m_pActiveTab`: during the callback `GetActiveTab()` is still
  the old tab. The Advanced Material Editor's workspace switch read it and handed the selection the wrong way.
- **Wuthering Waves `_N` maps are `Normal_Roughness_Metallic`**: every material instance exported beside
  Shorekeeper and Chisa names the `_N` texture so. RG normal; alpha roughness (cloth 0.85-1.0, metal dark,
  skin about 0.35); blue metalness with a dielectric baseline (Shorekeeper's cloth 16-47 of 255), leather
  around 96-143 and metal parts 176-231. `_ID` maps hold material IDs in green (20-109) and a mask in red;
  hair has only a 256 x 256 tiling `_HN` detail normal. Chisa's coat family (`Alpha`) has `_D` and `_N` but
  no `_ID`/`_HM`, and Shorekeeper's coat normal is named `Ahpla_N` by the game.

## R24: ARC9 view models, the menu realm, what a map load does (2026-11-08)

PoC (`out/r24/poc_r24.py` in the `r24` worktree: the PoC's loader, deployed package and data moved aside and back,
with a snapshot and a clean rollback each time), 1280 x 720, an unfocused window.

- **ARC9's warning** is `ARC9.BadConfigStuff.dx` in `lua/arc9/client/cl_warnings.lua`: `(render.GetDXLevel() or 0) <
  90 and !GetConVar("arc9_ignore_dx"):GetBool()`, checked on an ARC9 weapon's first deploy (`sh_think.lua`,
  `ClientStarted`), opening "ARC9: BAD GMOD SETTINGS WARNING" ("Outdated DirectX version ... DirectX 8 or 8.1").
  `render.GetDXLevel()` is 80 in an RTX start (95 with Remix off) although `mat_dxlevel` reads 90.
- **Every view model material runs a fixed-function shader under RTX**: [ARC9] Gunsmith Arms: Source's M249 draws all
  21 of its materials as `VertexLitGeneric_DX7` (lenses and reticles `UnlitGeneric_DX6`), each with a `$bumpmap` and
  `$phong` the path tracer never receives.
- **A client-side model's sub-materials do not reach the path-traced image**: ARC9 dresses a sticker's model (whose
  only material, `models/weapons/customization/stickers/sticker`, exists in neither pack: `___error`) with
  `SetSubMaterial(0..2, sticker)`. With Remix off the sticker shows; under RTX the error material shows (a white plate
  that z-fights with the receiver), and the gun screen charm (`models/items/arc9/att_screenbase.mdl`, a circuit board
  around `gs_screen`) its blank screen. `GetSubMaterial` reads back `""` for these models in both cases.
  `render.MaterialOverrideByIndex` around `DrawModel` does reach the image (the sticker texture then gets a Remix
  hash, `0x5255D21CEF521080`). R7 saw the same for `SetMaterial` on a client-side model.
- **ARC9's gun screens** draw text into the render target `arc9_gunscreen` (`cam.Start2D`, every frame) and put
  `effects/arc9/gunscreen` on the charm's index 2; drawn as 2D in the HUD pass the text is readable under RTX
  ("KILLS / PLY | NPC 0 0").
- **Stickers keep `$decal` as a flag**: `stickers/fas_logo` (`"$decal" "1"`, `$alphatest`, `$nocull`) has
  `$flags` 73986 = `MATERIAL_VAR_DECAL` (1 << 16) + `NOCULL` + `ALPHATEST` + 2, and no `$decal` key or parameter.
- **The render guard and ARC9**: ARC9's depth-of-field target (`GetRenderTargetEx("arc9_optic_dof_mask2", ..., I8)`)
  becomes the guard's inert target, so its `SetTexture` calls at `cl_vm.lua:371-382` are ignored (console lines
  only; ARC9's depth of field does not work under RTX anyway).
- **Load timings** with the user's 772 subscriptions mounted (`--workshop`), gm_construct, the main thread sampled
  every 10 ms (`out/r24/load_profiler.py`): RTX start: server Lua about 20 s (ARC9's `sh_atts.lua` and
  `sh_arc9_autorun.lua` the largest Lua share, about 10 % of all samples; this package about 5 %), then about 8 s with
  `filesystem_stdio.dll` CPU-bound at 93 % and almost no disk reads (file lookups across every mounted add-on), then
  client Lua about 18 s: about 43 s from the map's first material to five seconds after `InitPostEntity`. Remix off:
  about 29 s. Disk reads peak at 530 MB/s (Samsung 980 PRO NVMe), so the load is not waiting on the disk here.
- **Windows' "hung" verdict outlives a busy moment, and held the PoC's map command about 340 s** (five runs, 339-343 s,
  RTX starts with the Workshop add-ons mounted; `seconds_to_map` about 416 s against 57 s with Remix off). The game
  was not holding anything: in that time the main thread ran `engine.dll`'s main loop (0x223c9a-0x223fc9: `PeekMessageA`
  with `PM_REMOVE` until empty, then the frame through `[0x4f18d0]->vfunc 0x28`; `CEngine::Frame` at 0x224780 is its
  frame limiter, `Plat_FloatTime` and `ThreadSleep` of at most 199 ms) and drew the menu at about 230 frames a second.
  `IsHungAppWindow` still called the unfocused `Valve001` window and its IME windows hung (from the Workshop remount,
  a blocking moment), and `poc_session.py` sent nothing to a "hung" window. A probe (`out/r24/hold_probe.py`) at 76 s:
  hung, yet a `WM_NULL` sent to it was answered in 0.4 ms; at 121 s Windows no longer called it hung, and that run's
  map loaded at 83.8 s. No hook on `PeekMessage`/`GetMessage` (user32's bytes as in any process; `engine.dll`'s import
  points into `USER32.dll`). Windows evidently renews its verdict only when the quiet thread gets a message (a focused
  window gets input all the time). `poc_session.py` now confirms a "hung" verdict with a `WM_NULL` (R24).
- **The load itself, RTX against Remix off** (the profile phases): server Lua (`[Draconic Base] Loading` to `Clientside
  Lua startup`) 8.4 s against 5.4 s, client Lua to `NL_PROFILE_READY` 35.7 s against 27.8 s; in the client phase
  `filesystem_stdio.dll` held 29 % of the samples against 16 % (about 10.4 s against 4.4 s), reached mostly through
  `client.dll` (70 %, where GMod's Lua file and material functions live) and `lua_shared.dll` (26 %).
- **Lua's file and material calls during a load**, timed per calling script by wrapping `file.*`, `Material`,
  `CreateMaterial`, `util.PrecacheModel`/`IsValidModel`/`GetModelMeshes`, `ClientsideModel`, `resource.AddFile` and
  `player_manager.AddValidModel` from the first autorun (`out/r24/file_probe.lua`; 772 add-ons, gm_construct): server
  4.1 s with RTX, 3.7 s without; client 6.1 s and 5.0 s. Largest: Extended Spawnmenu's
  `lua/autorun/rb655_extended_spawnmenu.lua`, 2,274 `file.Find` on the client (3.5 s; 1.5 ms a call with that many
  search paths); ARC9's `lua/arc9/common/attachments_bulk/*.lua`, `Material` for attachment icons on the server
  (`snow_camos_titanfall_apex.lua` 652 calls 0.5 s, `eft_scopes_bulk.lua` 56 calls 0.46 s, `gsr_uni_optics.lua` 82
  calls 0.36 s; about 2.5 s in all); `util.PrecacheModel` from the stock `util.lua` (111 calls, 0.6 s);
  `ragdoll_pain_expression_transition_sv.lua` (202 `file.Find`, 0.23 s). This package's largest is
  `remixlua/cl/cl_rtx_material_fixer.lua`, 724 `Material` calls, 0.42 s (RTX starts only).
- **GMod's menu realm** has no `lua_run_menu` (not in `engine.dll`, `client.dll`, `menusystem.dll`,
  `lua_shared.dll`); the loading panel is `lua/menu/loading.lua`: the engine gets it from the global `GetLoadPanel()`
  once (its `Init` sizes it to the whole screen) and keeps that reference, so a later wrapper of `GetLoadPanel` sees
  no load; then `OnActivate`, `StatusChanged(GetLoadStatus())` from its `Think`, `GameDetails(...)` and `OnDeactivate`.
  The stock `IsInLoading()` and `GetLoadStatus()` can be polled from the menu's `Think` instead. For a single-player
  game the engine calls `GameDetails` again late in the load with the server's own name ("My Garry's Mod Server")
  while `IsHostingGame()` reads false.
- **The menu realm cannot see a client realm's Lua convar**: with the companion's `nativeloader_language` created
  (`CreateClientConVar`) and set from the console, the menu realm's `GetConVar("nativeloader_language")` returned
  nothing (PoC, the notice's status line). The game keeps archived client Lua convars in `garrysmod/cfg/client.vdf`
  (`"CVars" { "nativeloader_language" "en" ... }` in the field), but `file.Read("cfg/client.vdf", "MOD")` from the
  menu realm did not give the value either (the line seeded there before the start); a file the client realm writes
  under `data/` can be read (`DATA`). **The menu realm has no `CompileString`** ("attempt to call global
  'CompileString' (a nil value)" in `[MENU ERROR]`); `RunString` it has (the stock `mainmenu.lua`'s `lua.Run` uses it). Steam Cloud keeps only `cfg/config.cfg` for GMod (`remotecache.vdf` of app
  4000 lists no other cfg file), so `client.vdf` stays per install.


## After R24: the Astra map companions under the native loader (2026-11-09)

The user's two public RTX companions, Cathedral of Mercury RTX (3797839157, for the map 3797706957) and the
Korolevskiy Theater's PBR resources (3803057911, for 3798883815), made in September 2026 by Codex Astra.

- **Format.** `data_static/astra/<map>/rtx/startup.json` (version 1: `files[]` of `{path, target, bytes, sha256}`,
  every `path` a `<sha256>.dds.dat` and every `target` `textures/<sha256>.dds`; `layer` the `mod.usda.dat`), an
  `index.json` (`data_static/astra_mercury_rtx/<map>/rtx/` for the Cathedral, `data_static/astra/<map>/rtx/` for
  the Theater: materials, `startup.hashes` with 6-8 hash aliases each, `lighting.lights` in Cycles' units), PNG
  atlases for a map-time writer (`materials/<...>/pbr/*.png`: 1.17 GB of the Cathedral's 3.38 GB, 0.40 GB of the
  Theater's 1.75 GB) and a client runtime that publishes through `AstraRTXBridge` (`require "astra_rtx_bridge"`,
  API 1, `Capabilities().startupAssetDiscovery`). Without the bridge the runtime stops at `bridge_unavailable`
  every 2 s and nothing else runs, lights included. The base maps are Blender imports: 574 (Cathedral) model
  chunks drawn with atlas `VertexLitGeneric` materials (`$color2` tint, `$selfillum`), collision as
  `PhysicsFromMesh` entities from `data_static/astra/<map>/collision/*.dat`, a BSP of 4 entities
  (`worldspawn`, `info_player_start`, `light_environment` at pitch -70, and the Cathedral's `water_lod_control`).
- **The hash aliases still match.** Computed offline for the fork's renderer `384581b1` (`xxh3_64` of the uploaded
  mips), every material of both maps uploaded under the package's runtime with a hash its `mod.usda` overrides:
  176/176 and 144/144 (`RemixMaterial.GetAllTextureHashes`, PoC, 1280 x 720).
- **Formats.** The Cathedral's mod was BC7 sRGB albedo 2048, BC5 normals 2048, BC4 roughness and metallic 1024
  (2.10 GiB); the Theater's every map BC7, roughness and metallic included (1.25 GiB). Remix reads roughness,
  metallic and height from the red channel; 104 of the Theater's 144 roughness maps and 20 of its 69 metallic maps
  hold other data in green and blue. As BC4 (each mip of the BC7 decoded, the red channel encoded again), 189
  maps came out within 36 dB PSNR on every mip of 16 px or more (worst 36.1 dB; the top mips 49-60 dB), 24 did
  not (sharp metal edges in the 128-512 px mips, block ranges of 120-220 levels, which BC4's eight levels per
  block cannot hold): 236 MiB less.
- **The old Cathedral runtime's cost.** Driven to its published state in LuaJIT (its own files, mocked GMod,
  bridge and fixes API; `bench_old.lua` in the worktree `addon-migration-optimization-44b7dd`'s
  `out/poc/astra-maps/bench`): 605-618 us of Lua and 752 KB of garbage per frame, at 60 fps 36 ms and 45 MB a
  second. Its `atmosphere.lua` and `tone.lua` `Think` hooks each called the main runtime's `GetStatus()` every
  frame, a deep copy of its whole state with all 176 materials' hash tables and every sub-runtime's status, the
  colour module's 176 audit rows among them. The Theater's runtime: 4.7 us and 3.8 KB per frame (its 4 Hz timer
  copies 144 hash sets).
- **ToPBR from a map add-on.** The Cathedral runtime converted its glass and pool through
  `MaterialPipeline.ToPBR.ProcessSingleMaterial` inside a `SetEnabled(true)` lease; since R19 (ADR 0112)
  `SetEnabled(true)` takes effect only while the player's `rtx_topbr_enabled` is on (default 0), so that route is
  closed to map add-ons.
- **What the RTX package does on these maps without help.** RTX Water finds the Cathedral's pool ("24 water faces
  on 1 planes (3204 tiles), type pool matched to the map's water; native core") and none in the Theater. The RTX
  fixes' `RemixCategoryManager` tags the Cathedral's atlas textures `0x1000` at map start. Light2RTX would turn
  `light_environment` into a distant light and set `rtx.skyBrightness` from its `_ambient` 1.5 s after
  `InitPostEntity` unless `rtx_api_map_lights_autospawn` is 0 by then (the PoC's `client.vdf` had it 0 already).
- **The companion's sky writes its own convars.** Following the map's sun, `startClock()` in
  `nativeloader_sky.lua` writes `nativeloader_sky_hour` and `nativeloader_sky_direction` with `RunConsoleCommand`
  at `InitPostEntity` (its own `changed()` ignores them through `writing`); another add-on's change callback on
  them fires. A player's change to either switches `nativeloader_sky_follow_map` to 0.
- **A Lua convar's saved value arrives as a change.** A callback added (by name) before another add-on creates
  its archived client convar sees the creation's default replaced by the saved value: the converted add-ons'
  autorun runs before the companion's (`gm_...` sorts before `nativeloader_sky.lua`) and saw
  `nativeloader_weather partlyCloudy -> clear` on a PoC whose `client.vdf` holds `clear`. The companion adds its
  own callbacks after creating the convars and never sees it. Callbacks added at `InitPostEntity` do not.
- **Frame time.** The Cathedral's nave (camera 0, -400, 120, pitch -3, yaw 90; 1280 x 720 windowed,
  `engine_no_focus_sleep 0`, `fps_max 0`, 20 s): with the converted companion (its own sky, 33 lights) 68.9 fps,
  median 14.3 ms, p99 24.9 ms; the RTX package alone (the companion's physical sky, vanilla materials) 73.7 fps,
  13.7 ms, 20.7 ms. One of seven PoC runs ended in a GPU device loss (Remix's `0x60D0DEAD`, 21:44:33, at a camera
  cut 3 s after an NRC re-init, 5.5 of 32.9 GB of video memory in use); the NVIDIA driver logged `nvlddmkm` event
  153 then, as it did 20 more times on this machine in the three days before, during other sessions' work.
- **Load and deploy.** The loader deployed both packages (1,205 changes, 3.3 GB) in 19.3 s at the PoC's first
  start with them; a new add-on build with unchanged textures was 4 changes in 1.1 s.
- **The Korolevskiy Theater's gaps** (the user's field report, 2026-11-09). Its collision (`data_static/astra/<map>/collision/`:
  `index.json` chunks with `origin`, `triangles`, `bounds`; each `.dat` 36-byte float triangles relative to the
  origin; 350,975 triangles) spans -1986.5 -1841.3 -182.6 to 1998.6 4182.2 2242.8, and the BSP's skybox box
  (`tools/toolsskybox`, traced from 0 1170 1000) -2115 -1970 -311 to 2127 4311 2371: 128 units out on every side.
  A 16-unit top-down grid of the lowest surface below z 400 found 35,006 of 94,250 cells with none, inside the
  footprint too: beside the stage, between the stage block and the -80 lower level. The sky `astra_gm_korolevskiy_theater`
  is six identical 512 px RGBA8888 faces of one colour, 31 48 88 (the Blender World's), which Remix under the
  map's `rtx.skyMode 0` and AgX grade showed as a bright lavender sheet (looking up) or black (looking down) in a
  gap. The floor there is `atlas_0008` (hash 3758E0FF63CC316C).
- **`PostDrawOpaqueRenderables`' second argument** (`bDrawingSkybox`) was true in the main view on every frame
  in the field game on the theater (126 of 126 calls in 2 s, with `false, true, false`), whose 2D sky shows; a hook
  that returns on it never draws. Only the 3D-skybox argument marks a separate pass.
- **An RGB888 VTF's Remix hash** is XXH64 (seed 0) of the top mip uploaded as X8R8G8B8, the bytes BGR0: a 4x4
  VTF of 31 48 88 hashed `0xFD37A6C7E845E677` in the game (`RemixMaterial.GetAllTextureHashes`), as predicted
  offline (the package's layer sets `rtx.useObsoleteHashOnTextureUpload = True`). A Lua `IMesh` drawn with an
  `UnlitGeneric` material is ray traced as a lit surface with the legacy material (roughness 0.7, metallic 0.01
  from the layer): the shell's navy read saturated blue under the theater's floor, a 20 20 22 grey as dark ground.

## R25: ARC9's scopes and the RTX runtime's raytraced render targets, a stuck spawn-menu drag (2026-11-09)

Read in the sources: ARC9 base from Workshop item 2910505837 (`gmpublisher.gma`, extracted to `out/r25/arc9base` in the
`r25` worktree), the RTX runtime fork `sambow23/dxvk-remix-gmod` at `c6b48ed1` (the commit `runtime/base.json` builds),
the RTX fixes' module source (`garrys-mod-rtx-remixed`, `fc478c0`), GMod's own Lua in the PoC install.

- **What ends path tracing for a frame**: `D3D9Rtx::makeDrawCallType` (`src/d3d9/d3d9_rtx.cpp`) answers
  "rasterized, inject RTX" for the first draw `isRenderingUI()` takes for UI: a fixed-function draw with an
  orthographic projection (`projection[3][3] == 1`) and depth writes off, or a draw with a texture of
  `rtx.uiTextures` bound. `internalPrepareDraw` then injects the path-traced image and preserves (rasterizes) or, with
  `rtx.skipDrawCallsPostRTXInjection`, drops every later draw of the frame, unless it targets a raytraced render target.
  A full-screen `render.DrawScreenQuad` drawn before the view model therefore leaves the view model rasterized over
  the path-traced image for that frame.
- **A read of the back buffer ends path tracing too**: the fork's `D3D9DeviceEx::StretchRect` and `GetRenderTargetData`
  (`src/d3d9/d3d9_device.cpp`, "Flush RTX compositing before reading the back buffer", added for Source's screenshots)
  call `D3D9Rtx::FlushCompositing` when the source is the implicit swap chain's back buffer: it injects the path-traced
  image there and sets `m_rtxInjectTriggered`, so `internalPrepareDraw` rasterizes (or drops) every later draw of the
  frame except draws into a raytraced render target. Source's `render.UpdateScreenEffectTexture`,
  `UpdatePowerOfTwoTexture`, `UpdateRefractTexture` and `CopyRenderTargetToTexture` with the screen bound are such
  copies. ARC9's `PreDrawViewModel` (`cl_vm.lua:240-243`) runs `render.UpdateScreenEffectTexture()` and
  `render.CopyTexture(render.GetScreenEffectTexture(), rt_prevm)` in every frame while `arc9_fx_adsblur_bleeding` is on
  (default 1; `arc9_prevm` feeds only `effects/arc9/vm_dof2`), and `DrawCheapBlur` (`:49-77`) another
  `UpdateScreenEffectTexture` plus GMod's `DrawBokehDOF`: in the PoC the ARC9 view model and hands were rasterized in
  every frame (Remix's albedo debug view showed them shaded, the stock SMG flat) with no 2D draw before them. Its
  `DrawTranslucentPass` (`cl_drawmodel.lua:246-272`) runs `render.UpdatePowerOfTwoTexture()` before the first
  translucent view model part; `DoHolosight` (`cl_holosight.lua:18`) an `UpdateScreenEffectTexture` that nothing reads,
  from `PostDrawViewModel`, which the base gamemode calls after the hands (`GM:PostDrawViewModel` draws them first).
- **Where the path-traced image goes**: `triggerInjectRTX` (a UI draw) passes no image, and `RtxContext::injectRTX`
  then composites into the bound color target (`m_state.om.renderTargets.color[0]`, `rtx_context.cpp:618`).
  `makeDrawCallType` takes UI only on a "primary" target, which `isRenderTargetPrimary` (`d3d9_rtx_utils.cpp:35`) decides
  by size alone (the back buffer's width and height): a 2D draw into a screen-sized target of an add-on, as the first
  2D draw of a frame, puts the frame's image into that target. ARC9's own `DrawRTReticle` pushes `arc9_optic_main`
  (full frame) and draws 2D there: with its screen copy before the gun skipped, the PoC's screen stayed black while
  aiming (HUD only, the albedo view as well) until a read of the screen came first.
- **GMod names no `IMAGE_FORMAT_BGRX8888`**: the global is nil (GMod exports `IMAGE_FORMAT_DEFAULT`, `RGBA8888`,
  `ABGR8888`, `RGB888`, `BGR888`, `RGB565`, `ARGB8888`, `BGRA8888`, `RGBA16161616` and `RGBA16161616F`); a
  `GetRenderTargetEx` call with it passes nil as the format, which the companion's render guard answers with its inert
  1 x 1 target ("unreviewed RTX color format"). Source's value, 16, is in the guard's reviewed list.
- **Raytraced render targets** (`rtx.raytracedRenderTarget.enable`, default true; the package's defaults list one hash,
  `0x6FFDC1AC626F4AA6`, in `rtx.raytracedRenderTargetTextures`): a target is known by its descriptor hash,
  `D3D9_COMMON_TEXTURE_DESC::CalculateHash()` = XXH3-64 over the 44-byte description (`Width, Height, Depth, ArraySize,
  MipLevels, Usage, Format, Pool, MultiSample, MultisampleQuality` as 32-bit values, then the bools `Discard,
  IsBackBuffer, IsAttachmentOnly` and a zero byte; `d3d9_common_texture.h`); `dxvk_GetTextureHash` (the API) returns
  the counter-based image hash instead, so the descriptor hash cannot be read from Lua. A draw into such a target is
  path traced with `CameraType::RenderToTexture` (its camera taken from that draw's matrices,
  `CameraManager::processCameraData`), unless the sky test calls it sky: for such draws `checkSkyAutoDetect` sees no
  camera positions, so with `rtx.skyAutoDetect = 2` (the package's) a draw without a depth test counts as sky and is
  dropped. A draw that samples such a target gets `OPAQUE_SURFACE_MATERIAL_FLAG_IS_RAYTRACED_RENDER_TARGET`; a primary
  ray that hits it continues (PSR) as `rayCreateRenderTarget(renderTargetCamera, uv, ray)` (`ray.slangh`): from the
  camera's position, through `frac(uv)` of its frustum. The continued ray keeps the hit surface's object mask, so from a
  view model surface it can meet view model geometry (`primaryRayMaskToObjectMask`, `geometry_resolver.slangh`).
- **Hash sets set through `RemixConfig` add**: the fixes' `RemixConfig.SetConfigVariable` calls `remixapi_SetConfigVariable`,
  which reads the value into the runtime's user layer (`readOption(..., getUserLayer())`); for a hash set `readValue`
  calls `HashSetLayer::parseFromStrings`, which inserts into the layer's positives (a `-` prefix: negatives) without
  clearing, and the layers merge. `RemixConfig.GetConfigVariable` reads `rtx.conf` on disk, not the live value. The
  fixes' Lua has no binding for `AddTextureHash` on this option (`RemixMaterial.SetHashCategory` maps fixed categories).
- **ARC9's magnified ("new") scopes** (`ARC9_ENABLE_NEWSCOPES_MEOW`): `cl_rendertarget.lua`'s `PreRender` hook calls
  `RenderRT(false, GetRTScopeMagnification())` while the active sight's scope model has `RTScopeDrawingRN`;
  `RenderRTExpensive` pushes `arc9_optic_main` (full frame, RGB888, shared depth) and `render.RenderView`s a square of
  the screen's height in the middle (`x = scrw/2 - scrh/2`, `w = h = scrh`, `fov = ScaleFOVByWidthRatio(viewfov, 0.75)
  / magnification`, `aspectratio = 1`, `znear = 8`), then FXAA. Its `RenderScreenspaceEffects` hook (after the view
  models) calls `DrawRTReticle` every frame: the reticle as a square of `2 * (4 * RTScopeReticleScale *
  ScopeScreenRatio - (scrw/scrh - 16/9))` units 1.5 units ahead of a point that moves from the scope's front to the
  eye's line (`math.ease.InBack` of the sight delta), seen with `cam.Start3D(nil, nil, 90, ...)`, shadows and 2D black
  bars into `arc9_optic_main`, a copy to `arc9_optic_shaderpass` and the lens shader (`arc9/lense_shader`) over it; then
  `effects/arc9/rt` (a `Refract` material: it samples its texture at the pixel's screen position) gets
  `arc9_optic_shaderpass`, and `SetSubMaterial(RTScopeSubmatIndex, "effects/arc9/rt")` dresses the lens. Cheap scopes
  (`arc9_cheapscopes`, collimators, or low zoom without `arc9_fx_rtvm`) copy the screen instead and zoom the whole view
  (`GetMagnification`). Under RTX the guard refuses the FXAA and lens shader draws (the user's `cl_pipscope_new.lua:387,
  388, 689, 690`).
- **ARC9's sight blur draws into the image**: with `arc9_fx_adsblur_new` (default 1) and an RT scope as the active
  sight, `PostDrawViewModel` calls `RenderDoFMask(false)`, which pushes `arc9_optic_dof_mask2` (`IMAGE_FORMAT_I8`, which
  the guard replaces with its inert target and refuses to bind: the user's `cl_vm.lua:479`), refuses `ClearDepth`
  (`:483`), and then draws the scope model with `effects/arc9/blackunlit` and its glass index with `whiteunlit`. The
  guard suppresses screen-space draws inside a refused scope, not `Entity:DrawModel`, so that copy reached the image
  every frame (R24 read the guard's lines as harmless). ARC9's other blurs (`arc9_fx_rtblur`, `_reloadblur`,
  `_animblur`, `_inspectblur`, `arc9_cust_blur`; all default 0) run `DrawCheapBlur` in `PreDrawViewModel`: a
  `render.DrawScreenQuad` of `arc9_mat_halfblur` into the image just before the view model.
- **GMod's drag and drop never ends a drag whose release is lost**: `lua/includes/extensions/client/panel/dragdrop.lua`
  ends a drag in `DragMouseRelease` on the dragged panel (which `MouseCapture`s the mouse); `dragndrop.Think`'s "no mouse
  button is down, so force the drop" block is commented out, and the `DrawOverlay` hook `DragNDropPaint` paints every
  dragged panel at `gui.MouseX() - x + 8` each frame. A `ContentIcon` (128 pixels, the NPC-weapon badge at its top right
  for weapons) dragged while the spawn menu closes stays painted; the next `DragMousePress` on any draggable panel stops
  it.
- **Measured in the PoC** (`out/r25/qa-vm-c` in the `r25` worktree; RTX, 1280 x 720, DirectX level 80, the FA:S M249
  with the ELCAN, the game's field of view 75): literal render targets of 1016 x 508 and 1000 x 1000 keep their size
  (no power-of-two rounding). The descriptor hash formula above is right: with format 16 (`D3DFMT_X8R8G8B8`), the hashes
  computed for 1024 x 512, 1016 x 508, 1000 x 1000 and 2048 x 128 made Remix's debug view 821 flag the lens copy drawn
  with each target; for targets made the same way at 512 x 1024, 512 x 2048 and 256 x 1024, hashes computed as if they
  were `A8R8G8B8`, `R8G8B8` or `D3DUSAGE_AUTOGENMIPMAP` did not. ARC9's `GetRTScopeMagnification` (2.8 for the ELCAN)
  gave a scope field of view of 26.9 degrees (`ScaleFOVByWidthRatio` of the view's 91.3 by 0.75 is 75.0, divided by
  it). Mean frame times over 3 s (other work on the machine): 12.0 ms at the hip, 11.3 ms through the scope with the
  patch's path-traced picture, 19.5 ms with ARC9's own second view of the world. ARC9's HUD draws its hints ("Toggle
  Attachments", "Customize", "Toggle Safe") and an ammo card in perspective in `HUDPaint`; with nothing ending path
  tracing before it, the runtime traced them as lit objects (a white card in front of the gun in the albedo view).
- **ARC9's view model is drawn twice a frame** (its opaque and its translucent pass, each with `PreDrawViewModel`,
  `ViewModelDrawn` and `PostDrawViewModel`): the patch's lens count ran at twice its reticle count, and a screen read in
  the first `PostDrawViewModel` rasterized the second draw (the scope shaded, the lens copy black, as Remix's debug views
  23 and 821 showed). GMod's `PreDrawEffects` runs once after all view models. The FA:S M249 view model's render bounds
  are -32..171 x -162..131 x -508..32 (a whole animation's reach, not the gun), and outside rendering its `GetPos` is
  hundreds of units from the eye (757 in the PoC): measure it while it is drawn. Inside each pass ARC9 draws its
  holosights from `PostDrawViewModel` (`DoHolosight`, `cl_holosight.lua:18`, reads the screen first) and its lights' and
  lasers' lens flares from `ViewModelDrawn` (`DrawLightFlare`, `cl_light.lua:293-300`: `cam.Start2D` and
  `surface.DrawTexturedRect` when the light faces the eye, always for `Flashlight360`).
- **The runtime keeps a frame's first render-to-texture camera**: `RtCamera::update` returns early once
  `m_frameLastTouched` equals the frame (`rtx_camera.cpp:638-640`), so the first draw into any raytraced render target
  sets the camera for all of them that frame.

## After R25: what decides `rtx.useObsoleteHashOnTextureUpload`, and rpai's predictions measured (2026-11-09)

Read in the patched runtime tree the RTX package's build came from (`3cb32fb8`, the main checkout's
`out\worktrees\r17\out\runtime-src`); the facts rpai's `remixhash.resolve_obsolete_hash_option` follows:

- **Layers** (`src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_option_layer.cpp:710-790`, `RtxOptionLayer::initializeSystemLayers`): DXVK
  Config (priority 1), one layer per file of `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE`, else `dxvk.conf`; Hardcoded EXE Config (2), config.cpp's
  defaults for the executable; Remix Config (3), one per file of `DXVK_RTX_CONFIG_FILE`, else `rtx.conf`; baseGameMod
  Remix Config (4), a mod's `rtx.conf` when `rtx.baseGameModRegex` and `rtx.baseGameModPathRegex` match the game's
  command line (`rtx_mod_manager.cpp:116-129`); Environment Variable Overrides (5), Derived Settings (6), User Settings
  (`user.conf`, 0xFFFFFFFE), Quality Presets (0xFFFFFFFF) (`rtx_option_constants.h:186-194`). Paths are relative to the
  working folder, the game root.
- **Within one list the first file wins.** `makeLayerName` (`rtx_option_layer.cpp:51-61`) names a list's layers
  `00_<name>`, `01_<name>`, ... and the last one `<name>`; layer keys sort by priority, then by name
  (`rtx_option_constants.h:159-164`); `RtxOptionImpl::resolveValue` (`rtx_option.cpp:1134-1206`) takes a bool, int,
  string or full-strength float from the first layer in that order. So for an `rtx.*` option the first listed file that
  holds it wins in `DXVK_RTX_CONFIG_FILE` too (ADR 0062 measured it for `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE`). A package's
  `rtx_conf_layers`, which the loader lists before the user's `rtx.conf`, would therefore outrank the user's `rtx.conf`
  for `rtx.*` options, not lie below it as PACKAGE_FORMAT.md says; the RTX package has none.
- **`user.conf` applies every option it holds**: the User Settings layer's `UserSetting` category only counts and migrates
  miscategorized options (`rtx_option_layer.cpp:325-409`).
- **The option** (`rtx_options.h:1433`): no flags, no environment variable, default False. config.cpp's `g_appDefaults`
  sets it True only for `\hl2\.exe$` (the Portal-derived block from `config.cpp:469`, line 852) and `\halo(ce)?\.exe$`
  (`:371`), nothing for `gmod.exe`. `SetupForRtxFrom` passes it to `HashTextureData` (`d3d9_common_texture.cpp:761-768`),
  which zeroes X8R8G8B8's pad byte (`GetDefinedTexelBits`, `src/d3d9/d3d9_texture_hash.h:33-42`, `:123-152`).
- **How a conf line is read** (`config.cpp:994-1094`): keys of `[0-9A-Za-z._]`, case-sensitive; a `[name]` line makes
  the following lines count only when name equals `env::getExeName()` (`util_env.cpp:130-138`, case-sensitive); the
  value is the rest of the line after `=` and the blanks after it, every `"` dropped and trailing blanks kept (NV-DXVK
  removed upstream DXVK's stop at the first blank); a later line wins (`insert_or_assign`, `:1168`); an empty value counts
  as absent (`Config::findOption`, `config.h:326-329`). A bool is `true`, `false`, `1` or `0` in ASCII lower case
  (`:1242-1256`, `:1788-1792`); anything else leaves the layer's fresh value, 0, so False (`rtx_option.cpp:45-77`,
  `:410-414`, `:643-658`). A UTF-8 byte order mark makes the first line no key.
- **Lists**: `env::getEnvVar` reads into a `MAX_PATH` buffer (`util_env.cpp:47-55`), so a list of 260 characters or more
  reads as empty and the default file is used; `splitPaths` skips empty entries and trims nothing
  (`rtx_option_layer.cpp:34-47`).

**rpai's records against these rules** (`%USERPROFILE%\.rpai\work\*\hashes.json` and the field's Model Hotloader GMAs,
read only): XXH64 of the top mip as BGRA (flag 0x2000), BGR0 (no flag) or raw DXT blocks reproduced 251 of the 264 live
hashes whose VTF the field still has (113 alpha, 138 opaque), and 3 of the 3 ToPBR recorded
(`rtx-remix\mods\~gmod_topbr\game_materials.registry`, the hash being each record's fifth field). The 13 misses are
opaque sheets in records written by 2026-10-26 (Castorice, Cyrene, the first Firefly import, two `new_mmd_model`
imports): the single-colour sheet `c2013648c2e9b597` (1024 x 1024) was recorded as `0x4C8AA9BB54D3A930`,
`0x6CD8A24E251A7BE3` and `0x28AF73A540847E13` then, and as `0x84168AFC8CF54915`, its BGR0, in all 9 later records. No
record matched XXH3 or the other byte layout. rpai's own predictions had matched 122 of 135 live hashes in records made
with the option read as True, and 0 of 191 in those made from 2026-10-29 to 2026-11-08 with it read as False. The first
Firefly import's predictions of 2026-10-26 for its hidden ears and heels (XXH64, BGR0) equal the live hashes its remake
recorded on 2026-11-06. Ten work folders were not checked: their VTFs are in neither the field's Model Hotloader assets
nor its texture cache (compiled addons such as Robin, Eldreda and Elyms, and removed imports).

## After R25: Endfield's NPC, weapon and item map families (2026-11-09)

- **What Endfield rips ship** (41 models packed offline in `H:\BACKUP_20260815\Modding\ipg\AKEFRTX`, `work\src\NN`):
  beside `T_actor_<name>_<part>_<nn>` families, `T_npc_major_<name>_<part>_<nn>` (NPCs; the unmasked
  Endministrators are NPC rigs: `T_npc_major_endminfunmasked_*`, `..._endminmunmasked_*`), `T_wpn_misc_<nnnn>[_<nn>]`
  (weapons: `0016_01` Laevatain's sword, `0020` Da Pan's, `0057_01` Camille's second form) and
  `T_item_widget_<name>_<nn>`. The same roles: `_D`, `_N` (`_HN` for hair), `_P`, `_E`; NPC faces and bodies have
  only `_N`. The maps sit in `other tex\`, in a shader folder (`CamilleWingsShader_v1.0\tex\`) or beside the diffuse.
- **Why they abstained**: `Discovery::Named` (`game_matching.inl:130` after the seventh patch) took the Endfield layout
  only for `t_actor_` stems; anything else needed `_ID`/`_HM` (WuWa) or an `_MRA` under its `t_<word>_` prefix
  (Silver), so `Named` returned nothing and the family was never a UV candidate. An NPC sheet then abstained for
  "insufficient UV edge evidence" (a folder of NPC families only) or "conflicting exported family" (a `t_actor_`
  family won by UV, and the base's own exported stem differs).
- **Probe, production matcher before and after the eighth patch** (`out/efm/probe` in the `eager-torvalds-992bf3`
  worktree, names shown and hidden): AKEF 480 rows, 17 changed (222 to 239 accepted); R12's retained corpus
  (`out/archive-20261103/worktrees/r12-pbr/out/r12-b/corpus.txt`, 1,133 bases) 2,266 rows, 7 changed (535 to 542:
  copies of DeathGirl, Laevatain, Nefarith and the unmasked female Endministrator in `E:\G\Upload`), 18 rows
  "invalid model folder" in both runs (sources removed since R12); R23's WuWa corpus 98 rows, none changed. Every
  change is an exact-stem pairing with the Endfield layout; no names-hidden row changed.
- **Automatic equals manual**: the AKEF pack's SDK-free `GamePBR::Convert` build (`tools\game_maps\akef_game_maps.cpp`)
  on the patched headers gives, for all 17 sheets, the content keys and the byte-identical DDS of the pack's manual
  pass (`work\maps_manual.jsonl`, Endfield layout): content keys hash the map bytes, the base name and the layout,
  not the maps' paths. 14 convert; the `_N`-only faces and bodies find no eligible texel (`Convert` returns nothing).
- **Build**: `tools\ci\build_modules.ps1 -Only fixes` through `subst R:` gave the patched tree `source` `81da263b...`
  and a 5,519,360-byte module, SHA-256 `82ceef697486e28b9d44dfa9de5b03861e473aeb1dc7c8e0485f3745e9c5e4c5`.
- **ToPBR's `_E` maps do not glow**: `WriteOpaqueMaterial` (`usda.cpp:407-414` in the fixes) writes
  `emissive_mask_texture` and `emissive_intensity` but no `enable_emission`, whose default is false
  (`rtx_material_data.h:65` at the packaged fork commit `c6b48ed1`), and `rtx_materials.h:970` caches the intensity
  as 0 while it is off. Runtime patch 0001 carries that line as context only; 0019 enables emission for eye whites
  only.
- **What the `_E` maps hold** (the AKEF pack's 40 converted emission DDS, every seventh texel of the top level): a
  median of 0.6 % of texels above 8/255, at most 16 % (`T_wpn_misc_0016_01`, Laevatain's sword), then 8.5 %, 7.8 %
  (`T_wpn_misc_0057_01`) and 3 % or less; lit texels' mean 0.27-0.89 of full scale. So enabling emission lights only
  the parts the game lights. With the game record's fixed intensity 1, a lit texel (sRGB 0.3-0.9, linear 0.07-0.79)
  exposed at the PoC's daytime 1.52 (`adapted_yf` 0.115, so middle grey 0.175) is 0.6-6.9 times middle grey; at night
  the exposure sits at its cap of 16. The runtime's own default `emissive_intensity` is 40
  (`rtx_material_data.h:59`); the package's Poolrooms mod uses 8-18 for constant-colour lights and 0.29-0.59 for its
  caustics texture.
- **ToPBR republishes on content change**: `WriteModUSDA` (`to_pbr.cpp:4736-4760` with the nine patches) writes the
  staged layer, keeps the old file when the bytes are the same and publishes otherwise; the worker polls every 3 s
  (`:5037`). A writer change therefore reaches an existing install in its next session, with no conversion.
- **MSVC pools identical string literals**: the module holds `"                bool inputs:enable_emission = 1\n"`
  once with or without the ninth patch, because the Advanced Material Editor bridge's `usda_writer.cpp:170` writes
  the same text; the patched tree's id, not a string search, shows what a build holds.

## R26: the sky below the horizon (2026-11-09, Claude)

**What the physical sky drew below the horizon** (the packaged runtime, `claude/r20-int` `3cb32fb8`: the base and
patches 0001-0040; paths under `src/dxvk/shaders/rtx/pass/atmosphere/`):
- **The air.** The atmosphere frame's origin is on the ground under the camera. `evalAtmosphereRadiance`
  (`atmosphere_common.slangh:465-482`) does not stop a ray aimed below the horizon at the planet (its near root is
  t = 0), so the sky-view LUT's lower half (`sky_view_lut.comp.slang:60`: elevation `l*l*sign(l)*pi/2` over the
  whole sphere) marches thousands of km through the planet with every sample's altitude clamped to 0 (`:554`), lit
  as ground-level air (`evalSunShadowingClampedToSurface`, `:380`). It saturates into one even haze with the sun's
  phase glow on it: grey-blue at noon, brown-orange at the golden hour, navy at night under the airglow.
- **No clouds, no high clouds.** The screen pass skips `viewDirYUp.y <= 0.001` (`cloud_render.comp.slang:174`),
  the high layer `viewDir.y <= 0` (`atmosphere_sky.slangh:1353`), and the secondary rays' dome LUT clamps its
  elevation to the horizon row (`atmosphere_common.slangh:739`).
- **Stars** are gone 1.1 degrees below the horizon (`smoothstep(-0.02, 0.1, y)`, `atmosphere_sky.slangh:483`); the
  airglow's van Rhijn boost `1 + 0.5 exp(-5y)` (`:544`) is 75 at the nadir.
- **The moons** are drawn wherever they are (`evalMoonDisk` has no elevation test), lit through
  `getAtmosphericTransmittanceForDir` (`:841`), whose below-horizon branch (`atmosphere_common.slangh:855`, `:897`)
  is near zero: a moon below the horizon is a black disc (PoC: the first quarter moon 17.6 degrees down at 02:00).
- **The sun disc** stops 1.7 degrees below the horizon (`sunDir.y < -0.03`, `atmosphere_sky.slangh:1088`).
- The LUT's lower half is read only by `evalSkyRadiance`: `sampleSkyAmbientForVolume` returns 0 below the horizon
  (`atmosphere_common.slangh:949`), the high layer reads the LUT at 9.8 degrees and at the zenith.
- **The planet does not come off**: `planetRadius`, `atmosphereThickness`, `flipUpAxis` and the time cycle all
  keep the ground under the camera, and the density is a function of the height above it.

**Where the PoC sees below the horizon**: `gm_flatgrass`'s world is x, y in [-15872, 15872], z in [-16128, 15872]
(lump 14's first model), its floor at z = -12800, and its sky brushes are not drawn as geometry. From
(12500, 0, 14000) along +x, every ray from the horizon to 75 degrees down passes beyond the floor's edge into the
void. Evidence in the `r26-sky` worktree's `out/r26` (`horizon_probe.lua`, sessions `s1` to `s3`).

**A mirror of the clouds** (session s1): continuous, but they read as a calm lake's reflection with the horizon as
its axis; a 1-2 pixel line of bare sky at the horizon where the screen pass skips |y| <= 0.001; and a bright patch
where a mirrored sun would be, the cloud bleed: it adds 0.15 (`cloudSkyBleedStrength`) times mip 4 of the dome LUT,
whose texels hold clouds lit for their own direction's angle to the sun. With the antipode's clouds, the cloud ray
held 0.0015 above the horizon and the bleed faded out over 6 degrees below (s2), none of the three remains.

**Off is unchanged** (s3, the packaged runtime, against s2, patch 0041, both at 1600x900; mean absolute difference
of 0-255 RGB): two consecutive shots of one runtime differ by 0.33-0.6 in the haze and sky (2.2 once, a uniform
exposure drift) and by up to 4.8 where clouds drift; the two runtimes differ by 0.34-0.58 in the haze and sky and
by up to 2.8 where clouds drift (the wind runs from each session's start). The one larger A/B value (3.9) is the
frame generation notice at the top right in one session's shot; outside it, 0.35.

**Frame times at 1600x900** (the PoC is CPU-bound there; one second per view, s2): partly cloudy 5.99 / 6.26 ms off
/ on looking out over the horizon, 5.87 / 6.25 at 15 degrees down, 5.40 / 5.60 at 50 degrees down; clear golden
hour and night 0.1-0.2 ms more on; overcast on 6.8 ms out.

**Frame times at 3840x2160** (s4: the imported `d3d9.dll` `35ce5008...` in the package built from the branch,
`engine_no_focus_sleep 0`, `fps_max 0`, one second per view after a 10 s settle; no other PoC session ran meanwhile,
but other agents' work on the machine may have skewed the absolute times):

| State | View | Off (ms) | On (ms) | On - off |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| partly cloudy 13:00 | out (the horizon in the middle) | 10.17 | 11.61 | +1.44 |
| | 15 degrees down | 9.84 | 11.61 | +1.77 |
| | 50 degrees down | 8.39 | 9.61 | +1.22 |
| overcast 13:00 | out | 11.37 | 14.17 | +2.80 |
| | 15 degrees down | 10.80 | 14.02 | +3.22 |
| | 50 degrees down | 8.27 | 10.10 | +1.83 |
| clear, golden hour | out | 8.70 | 9.22 | +0.52 |
| clear, night | out | 8.73 | 9.32 | +0.59 |

The extra time is the screen-space cloud pass marching the pixels below the horizon, which it skipped before: as
much again as the clouds above them cost where the view is split at the horizon, most for a closed deck at grazing
angles. Looking down, the antipode's clouds are near its zenith, short rays through the slab. Off, nothing is
marched or sampled differently.

## R26: what makes a map load slow with hundreds of add-ons, and what answers it (2026-11-09)

The PoC's `bin/win64/filesystem_stdio.dll`: 970,064 bytes, linked 2026-10-26 20:48:35 UTC, SHA-256 `814373ea10b7e4e4...`.

- **Its file imports**: `CreateFileA`, `CreateFileW`, `GetFileAttributesExA` and `GetFileAttributesExW` from
  `KERNEL32.dll` by name, one import slot each (RVAs `0xab220`, `0xab180`, `0xab248`, `0xab098` in this build). In an
  RTX start the loader's read redirects already sit in those slots (ADR 0013's search hooks sit on `FindFirstFile*`
  in starts without RTX); either calls Windows through pointers of its own, so a second hook chained after them never
  recurses.
- **GMod's add-on table**: the DLL exports `?g_pFullFileSystem@@3PEAVIFileSystem@@EA` (RVA `0xf2518`); the object it
  points to holds the `Addon::FileSystem` object at `+0x550` (its vtable's RTTI name `.?AVFileSystem@Addon@@`). In it:
  `+0x08`/`+0x10` the directory map's head and size, `+0x18`/`+0x20` the add-on list's head and size (MSVC
  `std::map`/`std::list`; a tree node's `_Left` at 0, `_Parent` 8, `_Right` 0x10, `_Isnil` 0x19, the value at 0x20).
  A directory node's inner map: head `+0x40`, size `+0x48`; an entry's key (the name) at `+0x20`, then the name again
  `+0x40`, its directory `+0x60`, size `+0x80`, offset `+0x88`, owner `+0x90` and a flag `+0x98` (1: a marker entry
  keyed by the `.gma` path, present at every directory level an add-on has files under). Keys are lowercase with `/`,
  no trailing slash, and there is no `""` root directory. A list node: the `.gma` path `+0x10`, the title `+0x30`, the
  owner it files its entries under `+0x50`.
- **`file.Find(pattern, <title>)`** (`Addon::FileSystem::FindFirst`): one walk over every directory that has an entry
  of an add-on with that title, matching the pattern's last part (the folders), then a `lower_bound` of the pattern's
  folder for the files: about 2.5-2.9 ms a call with 774 add-ons. Two add-ons with one title give a name once. A
  wildcard in the folder part (`lua/?utorun/*`) gives no tables at all. Its only callers are Lua's.
- **Without RTX the loader hides every add-on folder of the combined package**: `requires_remix` is per package, and
  `tools/package_workshop.py:155` marks the combined manifest when any part has it, so the PoC's `session.json`
  `hidden_addons` listed all 25 folders of the package (`nlloadaccel` among them, and the Model Hotloader's library
  folders `mmdhl_*`). GMod never mounts the package's archive either (section 14, "GMod's own mount"), so no Lua of
  the package runs in such a start.
- **The menu realm cannot write files**: `file.Write` there fails at `lua/includes/extensions/file.lua:24`
  ("attempt to call method 'Write' (a nil value)"): the file object it opens has no `Write`. The menu realm's
  `require` loads a module's `gmsv_` copy.
- **What the cache answers** (the PoC, the user's 774 subscriptions mounted, gm_construct, RTX start, the checks on so
  every answer was also asked of Windows): 1,743,871 hooked calls, 1,585,988 answered as missing (91 %), 2,882 passed
  on inside a cached folder, 194 directory listings in 25 folders, 0 disagreements with Windows, no folder dropped.
  The overlay's load window alone (from the first material to five seconds after `InitPostEntity`) held 1,449,260 of
  them. The index: 117,720 entries, built once. Extended Spawnmenu's 2,253 searches answered from it (2 left to GMod).
  Every mounted title searched with 17 patterns, the index against GMod (13,158 searches, 17.3 s for both): 0
  different, 790 unanswered (the folder-wildcard pattern for each title, and one title GMod's table does not hold).
- **A start left out once**: a marker of a process that is gone, planted before an RTX start, made the menu, server
  and client copies all say "left out once", and the marker was gone after it; a start without RTX before it left the
  marker untouched, and the first RTX start removed its own marker 20 s after installing the hooks (the build of that
  run; the marker is now held until a map has loaded with the hooks, as the review asked).
- **What it saves** (`timing`: the published package, 0.0.0-dev.20261109063824, against the one built here with the
  review's fixes and the sky merged; RTX starts, alternating, verify off; seconds from the server's first Lua (t0) to
  `InitPostEntity` (ipe) and to the game responding, no frame over 100 ms for 2 s (ready); "map loaded" is the load
  overlay's own measure):

  | Session | t0 to ipe | ipe to ready | t0 to ready | map loaded |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | published, 1st (the first start after the install) | 19.4 | 12.3 | 31.7 | 24.1 |
  | built here, 1st | 12.1 | 5.2 | 17.4 | 12.8 |
  | published, 2nd | 17.7 | 8.5 | 26.2 | 18.8 |
  | built here, 2nd | 12.0 | 5.2 | 17.2 | 12.6 |

  So about 9 s (a third) of a warm load: 5.7 s of the map load itself and 3.3 s of the freeze after it. The cache
  answered 1,586,263 of 1,746,334 hooked calls and the index Extended Spawnmenu's 2,253 searches; the index was built
  once, in 16 ms (117,720 entries). Each session with the accelerator ended with its marker taken off (`settled`), and
  the next one installed the hooks again.
- **The off switch cannot be a convar the menu reads**: the add-on's `nativeloader_load_accel` is a client realm's
  Lua convar, which the menu realm does not see (R24, above), so the client keeps `data/nativeloader/load_accel_off.txt`
  for the menu while it is 0.

## R27: HUD add-ons and render targets under RTX (2026-11-09)

- **HUD Mk.2 (Workshop 3505713469, `lua/hud_mkii/utils/sfx.lua`)** asks at `timer.Simple(0)` for
  `GetRenderTargetEx('NeneS-hud-hudrt-<W>-<H>', W, H, RT_SIZE_NO_CHANGE, MATERIAL_RT_DEPTH_ONLY, 16+256+512+32768,
  CREATERENDERTARGETFLAGS_UNFILTERABLE_OK, IMAGE_FORMAT_RGBA8888)`, creates three `UnlitGeneric` materials with
  `$basetexture models/debug/debugwhite` (`$translucent`, alpha 0.75; two tinted, one `$additive`) and sets the target
  as their base texture. Each frame it pushes the target, clears it (`render.Clear(0, 0, 0, 0, true, true)`), draws the
  HUD (stencil masks in `utils/rect.lua`, scanlines with `render.OverrideBlend(true, SRC_ALPHA, SRC_ALPHA, ADD, ZERO,
  ONE, ADD)`), pops it and draws the three materials over the screen.
- **Stock GMod** (the PoC without RTX) gives that request a colour target: the material's base texture became
  `nenes-hud-hudrt-1280-720` and the HUD drew normally.
- **Under RTX before R27** the guard refused the target (ADR 0086), refused the three `SetTexture` calls (inert target),
  made the push virtual (its clears and textured draws skipped) and let the composite through with
  `models/debug/debugwhite`: the screen was white.
- **A full-screen colour target under RTX** (a probe, 1280x720 RGBA8888, 90 frames of 2D into it and 90 of it over the
  screen, `MATERIAL_RT_DEPTH_NONE`, `_SHARED` and `_SEPARATE`, clears of colour or of all, stencil and colour/alpha
  write overrides): no fault in any. The stencil test inside the target works with `_SEPARATE`, `_SHARED` and with
  `_ONLY` allocated natively (the guard switched off for the allocation); `_NONE` has no stencil (lines everywhere).
- **Separate alpha blending in a target under RTX**: black lines drawn over a transparent target with alpha factors
  ZERO/ONE ("keep the target's alpha"), the target then drawn over the screen: stripes outside the drawn rectangle 0.1
  levels without RTX, 2.7 with RTX; with alpha writes off for the pass also 2.8; plain blending 4.7 and 6.7. HUD Mk.2's
  scanlines therefore show faintly over the whole screen under RTX (7.8 levels on the sky against 0.1 with them off).
- **Two crashes during the checks were not the fix's**: two PoC sessions with both add-ons ended in an access
  violation in `shaderapidx9.dll+0xd7ff` (a mesh's vertex buffer null at `SetStreamSource`, `[rbx+28h]`; the frames
  below are `materialsystem.dll` and `engine.dll`, not the 2D surface), at 17:06 and 17:15 local, while another
  session's RTX game ran its RAM-exhaustion reproduction on the same GPU and crashed itself at 16:54, 17:04 and 17:13;
  that game, without this change, also ended in the same `engine.dll` 0xC0000409 at 16:07, 17:49, 17:56 and 18:01
  (GMod's crash handler after a fault). The dump recorded 32 GiB of RAM available and a peak commit of 104 GiB. Later
  sessions with both add-ons and the fix passed (two), as did HUD Mk.2 alone, a step-by-step bisect of its effects and
  every render-target probe.
- **The loader's running-game check refused a deployment once** ("Garry's Mod is running from this folder") while
  another copy's game ran: `deploy.cpp` `game_running` counts a `gmod.exe` it cannot open (`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`) as
  running from this folder; at the next start every other `gmod.exe` could be opened and the deployment went through.

## Issue #2: lag, RAM and the game that lingers after a crash, with 654 Workshop add-ons (2026-11-09, Claude)

Report: [handover/issue-2-memory-report.md](handover/issue-2-memory-report.md). A vanilla copy of the game with the
published package, the loader's minimum memory profile and low tier, 1920x1080; the 654 public items of collection
3836929038 mounted with `game.MountGMA`.

- **Where a frame goes** (gm_friluft, hook timing alone): with RTX 7 fps (142.7 ms a frame), 599.9 ms of every second
  inside client Lua hooks; without RTX 50 fps (19.9 ms), 505.4 ms/s. HyperReal FX (item 3830761570) takes 49.4 ms
  (`HRX_StageB`, `PreDrawViewModels`) and 17.9 ms (`HRX_StageC`, `RenderScreenspaceEffects`) a frame with RTX,
  0.46 and 0.31 ms without: its `render.UpdateScreenEffectTexture` copies, full-screen shader passes and
  `render.CapturePixels`/`ReadPixel` read-back every 0.5 s cost about 90 times more through the runtime.
- **The fixes' light updater** draws one helper model per map light each frame
  (`cl_rtx_light_updater.lua:1013-1016`): 1.95 ms a frame for 182 lights on gm_friluft (10.7 us a light); gm_skyport
  has 4,606.
- **Hooks with the collection**: 3,150 client hooks and 945 net receivers, 2,547 server hooks and 739 receivers. Many
  server `Think` hooks walk `ents.GetAll()` every tick; the hottest sampled lines were the base game's
  `Entity:__index` (`lua/includes/extensions/entity.lua:30`), `IsValid` (`util.lua:316`) and `GetConVarNumber`
  (`util.lua:588`).
- **Source's preload pass**: `materialsystem.dll` holds `mat_forcemanagedtextureintohardware` (default 1) and the
  material `engine/preloadtexture`; at the end of a load every loaded texture is drawn once and the runtime creates
  its image (7,574 images, 4.87 GB with the collection). At 0 the pass is gone (VRAM peak 10.96 -> 7.06 GB); Lua's
  `RunConsoleCommand` refuses the convar (`client.dll` lists it beside `mat_picmip`).
- **Game-texture copies stay resident**: DXVK keeps a managed texture's CPU copy in a host-visible Vulkan buffer
  (`d3d9_common_texture.cpp:255-283`); at a crash Windows trimmed the game's private working set exactly to its GPU
  shared memory (6.99 of 6.99 GB) and no further.
- **Windows Error Reporting snapshots a crashed process** (Windows 11 26300, default settings): the system's commit
  rises by the process's private bytes while the first WerFault runs (+9.3 GB for an 8 GB Python process with error
  mode 0, +22-26 GB for the 20 GB RTX game), the page file grows, the process's working set is trimmed; the game took
  11-12 s to go, and terminating it does not release the snapshot. `WerSetFlags(WER_FAULT_REPORTING_DISABLE_SNAPSHOT_CRASH)`
  (`werapi.h:69-72`, value 128) removes all of it (+0.06 GB, 5.8 s) and WER still files its report with a dump.
  A process whose error mode has `SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX` (agent shells pass it on) never reaches WER.
- **End task** on a frozen or a responsive RTX game (`user32.EndTask(hwnd, FALSE, TRUE)`): gone within a second, no
  WER, no hang report (window ghosting is off since loader 0.12.1).
- **GMod's engine fail-fast**: `0xC0000409`, parameter 5, at `engine.dll+0x34b6bc` on a worker thread started at
  `tier0.dll+0x1c9d0`, in sessions with and without RTX and the collection; WER dumps keep only 4-5 KB of that stack.
- **`game.MountGMA`** refuses absolute paths and takes paths relative to `garrysmod/`; a map inside a mounted archive
  logs "Couldn't write cache/map_pack.bsp to mount embedded content!" although GMod writes the file.

## R28: what lags an RTX frame, the runtime's light lifetime, and the crash behind issue 2 (2026-11-10)

Measured in this round's own vanilla copy of the game (`out/r28/game` in the main checkout, 2,877 depot files copied
with `make_vanilla_copy.py`; another session held the PoC), 1920x1080 windowed, `-noworkshop`, gm_construct unless
said, an RTX 5090. Driver `out/r28/lab.py` in the `r28` worktree; report [handover/R28-report.md](handover/R28-report.md).

- **What a render hook's calls cost under RTX** (`cost_probe.lua`, the published package, 12.2 ms a frame): four
  `render.UpdateScreenEffectTexture()` 0.012 ms; `render.UpdateRefractTexture()` 0.009 ms;
  `render.CopyRenderTargetToTexture` of a full-screen target 0.011 ms; a full-screen target pushed, cleared and popped
  0.021 ms; eight plain passes into it 0.079 ms, eight with a refused `screenspace_general` material 0.180 ms (the
  guard's refusals); `render.ReadPixel` 0.002 ms. **`render.CapturePixels()` 20-29 ms each** (a 1x1 target or the back
  buffer, every 15th frame), 12.4 ms each when made every frame (the frame then 24.5 ms): it waits until the GPU has
  drawn everything queued, one to two frames. `render.RenderView` into a 256x256 target 2.6 ms and +6.5 ms a frame.
  `render.Capture` (a JPEG of the screen) 76 ms. **Twenty `surface.CreateFont` calls a frame with one unchanged
  definition:** 0.4 ms in the calls, the frame 29.4 ms instead of 12.2 (the engine builds every font's glyph pages
  again).
- **HyperReal FX's 67 ms a frame were read-backs.** Its two `ReadRTPixel` sites read a 1x1 target every 0.5 s
  (`render.CapturePixels`, `render.ReadPixel`); at the issue's 143 ms a frame a read waits about 200 ms (the hooks'
  worst calls: 207 and 196 ms), and two of those a second are the measured 49.4 + 17.9 ms a frame. Its copies and
  passes cost hundredths of a millisecond once the guard refuses its shaders.
- **A test add-on shaped like it** (`out/r28/addons/r28_hrxlike`: three stages, 18 `screenspace_general` passes and
  three screen copies a frame, two 1x1 read-backs every 0.5 s), gm_construct: with the published package 78 read-backs
  in 20 s at 11.4 ms each (worst 26 ms), frames 9.64 ms on average, 11.95 ms at the 95th percentile, worst 90.8 ms;
  with R28's package the same 78 calls take 0.02 ms each on average (eleven made in the first
  three seconds, the rest answered from the last picture), frames 7.99 / 9.08 / 13.4 ms; with the add-on
  switched off 7.80 / 8.75 / 11.9 ms. (The round's first rule, four fast reads running, made four: 0.02 ms each, frames 8.40 /
  10.32 / 14.9 ms.)
- **`WerGetFlags` from outside** (`kernel32`, a handle with `PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ`): a game
  with the published package answers `0x80070490` (not found: the process never set a flag); with R28's package
  `S_OK` and 384 (`WER_FAULT_REPORTING_DISABLE_SNAPSHOT_CRASH | _HANG`) from about 25 s after the process started
  (the menu's Lua loads the engine guard), for the rest of the session.
- **The engine's fail-fast in issue 2 is GMod's crash handler failing.** The Windows Error Reporting dumps of the
  issue 2 lab (`out/issue2/wer-dumps`, read with `out/r28/crash_stack.py`, which takes a thread's stack from the
  dump's Memory64 list) show the failing thread inside the C runtime's `_write` (`engine.dll+0x36f588`): the file
  descriptor (3) is in range (`_nhandle` 64) but not open, so the runtime calls its invalid-parameter routine
  (`+0x34b59c`), which fails fast (`+0x34b6bc`, `int 29h` with 5) because no handler is set. The buffer being written
  starts `-Console Buffer-`: the text half of GMod's own crash report (`crashes/<id>.txt`), which in all six sessions
  ends after `-Lua Stack Traces-`. So a first fault had already happened and GMod's handler had written its
  minidump. Those minidumps (`evidence/engine-crashes`) give the first faults: an access violation at
  **`studiorender.dll+0x6603b`** (reading `0xffffffffffffffff`; three sessions, two of them in an NPC wave with the
  654 add-ons) and at **`shaderapidx9.dll+0xd7ff` / `+0xd759`** (reading `0x1c` from a null pointer; three sessions,
  one while quitting, one on gm_construct with nothing mounted), the latter the same fault as R27's two PoC crashes (a
  null vertex buffer). Every one of them then reached Windows Error Reporting through the handler's own fail-fast.
- **How the runtime keeps a game light** (`out/worktrees/r17/out/runtime-src`, `17dcc86c`):
  `LightManager::garbageCollectionInternal` (`src/dxvk/rtx_render/rtx_light_manager.cpp:110-136`) erases a light not
  set in the current frame when `rtx.suppressLightKeeping` is on (the package's `classic_remix_defaults.conf:109`),
  unless light anti-culling (`:61` of that file) marked it outside the view and fewer than
  `rtx.antiCulling.light.numFramesToExtendLightLifetime` (1000, `rtx_options.h:744`) frames have passed since it was
  set. Only `D3DLIGHT_POINT` lights get the anti-culling type that can be outside (`addGameLight`, `:650-669`):
  their sphere (the light's position and the converted radius, `rtx.lightConversionSphereLightFixedRadius` 9 here,
  `rtx_lights_data.cpp:399`) is tested against the camera's own frustum (`RtCamera::updateAntiCulling`,
  `rtx_camera.cpp:582-592`, `fovScale` 1); spot and directional lights keep "inside" (`:152-186`). With
  `suppressLightKeeping` off a light steady for 50 frames (`numFramesToKeepLights / 2`) is never erased again.
- **What a helper's draw sets.** The engine lights a model with the strongest world lights where it stands: up to
  four (`r_worldlights`), none dimmer there than `r_worldlightmin` (0.0002), each from a cluster the model's leaf can
  see and reached by a ray against the world. A helper therefore sets its own light and three neighbours, and the
  world lights (BSP lumps 15 and 54, 88 bytes each: origin, intensity, normal, cluster, type, style, cone,
  attenuation) include what no entity stands for. `out/r28/world_lights.py` on the test maps: gm_construct 138 (108
  point, 28 spot, the sun and its ambient; 31 with a style; 78 plain `light` entities, each on a point world
  light); gm_backrooms_classic 1,126, all point, one with a style; gm_backrooms 1,007 (960 point, 47 spot);
  **modern_house 2,828: 991 point, 35 spot, 1,800 texture lights** (`emit_surface`), the sun; gm_br_pitfalls 2,649
  (564 point, 1,709 spot, 374 texture lights); gm_liminal_hotel 566 (547 point, 13 spot, 4 texture lights). Their
  visibility lumps are 0.2-1.1 MB (2,098 clusters on gm_backrooms_classic, 2,377 on modern_house). With the light
  updater on, the fixes switch `rtx.ignoreGamePointLights` and `rtx.ignoreGameSpotLights` off
  (`cl_rtx_settings.lua`), so a texture light the engine sets for a helper reaches the runtime, as a spot light,
  which the runtime drops the frame it is not set.
- **The runtime hands a light that stops to a new one.** `LightManager::dynamicLightMatching`
  (`rtx_light_manager.cpp:190-238`, called every frame from `rtx_scene_manager.cpp:3029`, before the garbage
  collection): a light whose last touch was the frame before (`getFrameLastTouched() + 1 == currentFrame`) and
  that is not new is compared with every light that is new this frame; the most similar one within
  `rtx.uniqueObjectDistance` (300, `rtx_options.h:594`; `isSimilar`, `:567`: the same type, a point light with a
  point light) becomes "dynamic", takes over its buffer index and identity (`updateLight`, `:614`), and the old
  light is erased. A game light's identity is its position (`LightData::createFromPointSpot`,
  `rtx_lights_data.cpp:392-451`: the hash is the position and, for a spot light, its cone; not its brightness), so
  a dynamic light that moves is a new light every frame. With every helper drawn every frame no map light is ever
  in the first state; with the draw list each bounded light is, for the frame after its helper stops.
- **In the game the hand-over shows as copies of the moving light.** gm_backrooms_classic, six poses 260 units
  from a map light and looking away from it, a white `DynamicLight` from Lua going round the eye at 120 units once
  a second and standing still for the last 30 frames before a screenshot, a model of its own drawn where it is
  every frame, `rtx.autoExposure.enabled` off for the probe (`out/r28/light_probe9.lua`); a pair is every helper
  (260 frames) and then the list (500 frames). **The build before the fix** (the list by view and turns alone): all
  six pairs differ, the list's picture brighter by 12.4-42.1 levels in red and green and by 8.9-22.7 in blue
  (largest of 64 blocks 17-72), the share of blue up in every pose (0.05 to 0.22 where the standing light itself
  is behind a wall). By the code: the new light that takes a stale light's buffer index is no longer new
  (`updateLight`), so when a stopped map light is matched first, the moving light's own previous copy finds no
  match; out of view it is a point light the anti-culling keeps for 1000 frames. **The final build:** poses 1, 3
  and 5 match (0.3-0.6 levels, blocks 1-2.5); poses 2, 4 and 6 differ by 22.9-25.0. **The control** (the final
  build with every helper in both pictures of a pair, `--bounded 1`): poses 1, 3 and 5 match (0-0.9), poses 2, 4
  and 6 differ by 32.4-33.5. So in those three poses the second picture is brighter whatever is drawn: the probe's
  moving light leaves copies there by itself (the pictures are taken 260 and 760 frames into a pose, and a copy
  lives 1000), also with every helper and with the model that carries it. Why that model does not keep every frame's
  light matched was not pursued; it is the runtime's and older than this round. **A light that stands still**
  (`light_probe8.lua`, 120 units ahead): every helper, the list, every helper again: share of blue 0.248, 0.249,
  0.253, red and green the same within 0.4; without the light 0.031 and 0.027.
- **Judging a moving light by screenshots needs a control.** The first probes of this finding
  (`light_probe5.lua`, `light_probe6.lua`: no model at the light, the exposure free or held) showed more white
  with the list in both builds, which looked like a fix that did not work: a moving light with no model of its own
  reaches the runtime only in the frames a helper stands within its radius, every gap leaves a copy out of view,
  and the automatic exposure is still settling 30 frames after the light stops. A pair of pictures taken one after
  the other at one place also differs by what the first half left behind.
- **A dynamic light's fields can be written from Lua, not read.** `DynamicLight(key)` returns a `dlight_t` object
  (a fresh one per call); `light.pos` and `light.size` read back as nil with no error (`out/r28/light_probe7.lua` in
  the game). Whoever needs a Lua light's position has to see it written (the object's metatable has `__newindex`).
- **The runtime's light frustum is a frame late in its angle.** `RtCamera::update` calls `updateAntiCulling`
  (`rtx_camera.cpp:696`), which builds the frustum from `getViewToProjection()`, before it stores the frame's
  projection (`:703`): a zoom shows in the light test one frame later.
- **The free camera** (`rtx.camera.enableFreeCamera`, `rtx_camera.h:112`) makes `isLightAntiCullingEnabled()` false
  (`rtx_options.h:752`): no light is kept out of view. It is switched in the Remix menu; the fixes'
  `GetConfigVariable` reads `rtx.conf`.
- **ULib's hook library** (github.com/TeamUlysses/ulib, `lua/ulib/shared/hook.lua`): `Hooks[event][priority][name]
  = { fn, isstring }` behind `hook.GetULibTable()`, called in priority order -2..2, and beside it a plain table
  that `hook.GetTable()` returns. The render guard's `hook.Call` runs the events it protects from
  `hook.GetTable()`, so with ULib those hooks run from the plain table.
- **The light updater's cost** (the list as shipped, after the review): `PostDrawTranslucentRenderables` runs once a
  frame (`r_WaterDrawReflection 0`, `r_WaterDrawRefraction 0`). gm_construct has 171 light entities, 142 after the
  updater's ids, 78 of them steady point lights (no name, no style); every helper every
  frame 0.90-1.00 ms in the hook and 7.3 ms a frame. The map is under 256 lights, so that is also what the
  default does. With the list asked for (`rtx_lightupdater_all -1`; all 78 bounded, the 58 spot and switched
  world lights being set by their own helpers every frame): 65-71 helpers looking away from the buildings and
  88-121 looking at them, 0.46-0.84 ms in the hook and 5.4-6.8 ms a frame. (At 7 ms a frame the probe's second
  screenshot of a view is taken while the exposure still settles: a view looking down after one looking up differs
  by a uniform 5 %, block ratios 1.05-1.07.)
- **A helper costs the frame about three times what its hook shows.** gm_backrooms_classic (Workshop 2732733089,
  1,126 light entities, 1,125 of them steady point lights, all of their helpers bounded: the one styled light is
  set by its own helper), from one spot inside the map, six views, 1920x1080: every helper every frame 9.1-9.2 ms in
  the hook (8.2 us a helper) and 38.5-38.6 ms a frame; the list 28, 142, 652, 536, 13 and 13 helpers: 0.4, 1.3, 5.3,
  4.3, 0.3 and 0.3 ms in the hook, and frames of 9.4, 12.4, 26.1, 22.8, 9.2 and 9.2 ms. So each helper left out
  gives back 27-35 us: its draw is also an instance the runtime processes. Screenshot pairs (every helper against
  the list, the scene's left 60 %): mean differences of 0.6-0.8 of 255 levels, the largest of 64 blocks 1-2 levels,
  in all six views; after 400 frames facing one way and a turn to the opposite view, the settled picture matches. (The spawn point differs from run to run; the round's first list, bounded by a
  helper's own light alone, measured 30.9, 23.5, 11.4, 18.6, 9.5 and 9.5 ms from another spot.) gm_backrooms of the
  same item (1,011 helpers: 919 of steady point lights, all bounded, 47 of spot lights and 41 of switched lights,
  each set by its own helper), with the build before the rule for the lights round the eye: 39.2-39.3 ms against 15.3, 22.5, 25.6, 16.6,
  15.4 and 15.1 ms (115 to 489 helpers).
- **The same on a map with texture lights**, modern_house (Workshop 3495468649; 1,027 light entities, 990 of them
  plain `light`): 989 steady point lights, 959 of their helpers bounded (21 spot and switched
  lights are set by their own helpers; the 30 other helpers stand where a texture light could be among the
  engine's four). Six views from the spawn point, a fixed clear sky: every helper every frame 8.3-8.6 ms in the hook
  and 38.2-38.9 ms a frame; the list 634, 252, 431, 564, 318 and 197 helpers: 5.2, 2.2, 3.7, 4.8, 2.8 and 1.9 ms and
  frames of 27.7, 17.5, 22.8, 26.4, 20.0 and 16.4 ms; the pairs match (0.5-1.3 mean, largest block 1-3, 7 where a
  cloud drifted), and so do six pairs with a light 260 units behind the camera (0.6-0.8, block 1-2). Without the fixed sky (`nativeloader_weather clear`, `nativeloader_sky_time_passes 0`) the pairs
  differ by 20-30 levels: the sun goes behind a cloud between two screenshots. **Texture lights in the game:** the
  round's first list (bounded by a helper's own light alone) matched in six pairs there as well, and 19 helpers
  drawn 24 units in front of texture lights, with the updater's own hook off, changed nothing visible (0.54 mean,
  block 2): a patch's brightness there is 2-14 against the hundreds of a point light, and a point light stood
  within 83 units of every candidate, so the engine's four were mostly point lights. The rule stays for the rooms
  a texture light lights alone.
- **The preload with base content only** (gm_construct, then gm_backrooms_classic; the minimum profile, the low
  tier; `[RTX Managed Textures]` in the runtime's log): with `mat_forcemanagedtextureintohardware` 1 (the published
  package) 663 images (243 MB) were made by draws by the first pass and 720 (279 MB) after the second load; with 0
  (R28's package; the console echoes `"mat_forcemanagedtextureintohardware" = "0" ( def. "1" )`) 216 (97 MB) and 265
  (128 MB).
- **The helper's frame cost is not the path tracer's geometry.** The same spot on gm_backrooms_classic, every
  helper drawn under `render.MaterialOverride(rtx_lightupdater/rtx_lightupdater)` with that material's texture
  (hash `0xAC138F27DCFD8FA8`) set to the runtime's Ignore category (the runtime takes a draw's lights before it
  rejects an ignored texture, `D3D9Rtx::processRenderState`): 40.1 ms a frame against 40.2 and 40.4 ms as shipped,
  the hook 9.7 ms either way; with the bounded list 17.3 against 16.8 ms. Not used.
- **`render.GetViewSetup()`** on a 16:9 screen with a 90 degree view: `fov` 106.26 (the screen's own horizontal
  angle), `fov_unscaled` 90, `aspect` 1.778.
- **Light entities in the user's subscribed maps** (`out/r28/count_lights.py`, entity lumps read in place):
  gm_br_pitfalls 2,274 (564 point lights), gm_brmovie_complete 1,678 (293), gm_br_complex 1,253 (145),
  gm_backrooms_classic 1,126 (all point), modern_house 1,027 (991), gm_backrooms 1,007 (960), gm_mallparking_plus 701
  (364), gm_liminal_hotel 561 (547); gm_cathedral_of_mercury and gm_korolevskiy_theater have two.
- **The game's hook library** (`garrysmod/lua/includes/modules/hook.lua`, this build) is the classic one: a live
  table from `hook.GetTable()`, `pairs` in `hook.Call`, six return values.

## Model Hotloader imports: slow physics, no percentage, the crash once the importer shows a prop (2026-11-10, Claude)

The user's report: importing `E:\G\Upload\Ganyu_alt\1_PMX\花.pmx` (a static flower, "SkillObj_Ganyu_IceLotus_Model",
1,584 triangles, 2 materials) took long on its physics at what the user knew as the defaults, showed no percentage,
and every new import crashed the game once the importer showed it. Handover:
[hotloader-import-report.md](handover/hotloader-import-report.md).

- **The user's crash** (`native-loader/logs/sessions/2026-11-10T212505.066Z-36508-crash`, the Remix minidump; the
  field's and the PoC's `studiorender.dll` are the same build, SHA-256 `1dcb270d...`, `materialsystem.dll`
  `6c9075c5...`): access violation reading `0xffffffffffffffff` (a non-canonical address) at
  `studiorender.dll+0x6603b`, `movups xmm5,[rdx+0x20]` in the SSE 3x4 matrix concatenation at `+0x66030`, called from
  `+0x141b9` on a `vstdlib.dll` job thread running the material system's queued context (`+0x5cb21` <- `+0x5fea7` <-
  `materialsystem.dll+0x30f3a` ... `+0x1b311`). The caller at `+0x14080` is studiorender's loop over a model's
  **render meshes**, GMod's `ENT:GetRenderMesh`: count at `[rc+0x380]`, `IMesh*` at `[rc+0x388+i*8]` (four slots),
  `IMaterial*` at `[rc+0x3a8+i*8]`, 64-byte matrices at `[rc+0x3c8+i*64]`; per mesh it sets the material up
  (`+0x40a0`; it also reads the 32 per-index override slots `[rc+0x260+i*8]` and their types `[rc+0x360+i]`, GMod's
  `render.MaterialOverrideByIndex`), concatenates `[this+0xe0]` with the mesh's matrix, `LoadMatrix`es it (vtable
  `+0xa8`) and calls `IMesh::Draw(-1, 0)` (vtable `+0x68`). `rc` (`[this+8]`) was `materialsystem.dll+0x45be10`, in
  its 33 MB `.data` (the queued call's copy of the studio render context); `this` is the studiorender global
  (`+0xb2470`). The faulting pass was the first (`r14` 0, `r15` 0x388), yet `rbx`, the index times 64, held
  `0x18000000000`; `rbx` comes back from `+0x40a0`'s home slot, which held 0 when the dump was written, so the value
  changed under the thread while it ran. The same offset is R4's procedural glass crash and three of issue 2's.
- **The Hotloader's static props** drew through client entities `mmdhl_prop_piece`/`_translucent` (NoDraw, a
  placeholder model) whose `GetRenderMesh` returned `{Mesh=<the prop's Lua mesh>, Material=<its material>}`, drawn with
  `ent:DrawModel()` from `P.DrawAsset` (the importer's preview, the placed `mmdhl_prop`, the tool's ghost, the parts
  editor). The importer selects every new import itself (`ui.lua`, `library.lastImported`), so it drew the new prop at
  once. Characters draw natively (no `GetRenderMesh`). The fixes part's Seamless Portals add-on still uses
  `GetRenderMesh` + `DrawModel` (`seamless_portal/cl_init.lua`).
- **The importer's preview needs room**: it is docked to fill what the right column leaves, and the window scales with
  `ScrH()/1080` (1 to 2): at 1280x720 the controls take the whole column and the preview never paints (the PoC's
  default window); from 1080p, as at the user's 4K, about 170 x scale pixels are left for it.
- **What took the time** (the field's import registry `data/mmd_hotloader/static/sources.local.json` and
  `cfg/client.vdf`, read only; offline imports with the shipped worker, `mmdhl_worker.exe --request`): the user's game
  had `mmdhl_prop_import_collision "balanced"` saved (the convar's default has been `hull` since it exists, 2.1.0), and
  its registry holds the flower imported both ways (assets `e91a8f45...` detailed, `ec923e10...` single hull; offline
  imports give the same ids). The flower: 0.08 s with the single hull (every stage under 20 ms), 26.1, 36.2 and
  37.6 s detailed; as a character 0.16 s ("Fitting native collision anatomy" 11 ms: its fit fails, no humanoid bones).
  Ganyu (`甘雨.pmx`, 39,147 triangles, 24 materials): 3.3-4.4 s as a character (textures 2.2-2.4 s, Source materials
  0.5-0.9 s with their package 0.75 s, the fit 64-150 ms), 0.97 s as a single-hull prop.
- **CoACD 1.0.14** (the pinned wheel's `lib_coacd.dll`): imports only KERNEL32 (with `GetStdHandle`, `WriteFile`,
  `WriteConsoleW`, `GetConsoleMode`), ADVAPI32 and VCOMP140, so its C runtime is static and its logger is spdlog's
  Windows console sink, which writes through `GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE)` (`WriteFile` when that is not a console).
  `CoACD_setLogLevel` accepts `off`, `error`, `warn`, `warning`, `critical`, `info` and `debug`, and throws a C++
  exception (0xE06D7363) for `trace`. At `info` it logs its parameters, " - Manifold Check", " - Preprocess"
  (`Mesh Manifoldness: false` for the flower, remeshed at resolution 30 into 15,778 points and 31,568 triangles),
  " - Decomposition (MCTS)", then per pass `iter N ---- waiting pool: K` and `Processing [x%]` at about every tenth of
  the pool (unordered: OpenMP), " - Merge Convex Hulls", a warning when 16 hulls cannot reach the threshold ("Max
  concavity 0.17 exceeds the threshold 0.05 due to 16 convex hull limitation"), " - Simplify Convex Hulls" and
  `Compute Time`. `debug` adds nothing to the merge. Each pass splits every piece still above the threshold in two
  (pool K(n+1) = 2 x the unfinished pieces of pass n), so the pieces finished in pass n weigh 2^-n of the mesh and add
  up to exactly 1. The worker's flower: 16 passes, 138 pieces in 18 s, merge 17 s; a direct call with another weld
  order: 20 passes, 246 pieces in 21 s, merge 24-27 s (the merge costs every pair: about n^2 pair costs, 0.4-1.7 ms
  each); Ganyu's mesh: 10 passes, 36 pieces in 5.1 s, merge 2.0 s. The detailed asset ids are the same before and
  after this round's change.
- **Reproduced in the PoC** (the published package, RTX on, `mat_queue_mode 2`, gm_construct, 1280x720): the flower
  imported, placed and drawn for 1,078 frames, imported again with detailed collision, then about 3 s after a character
  import the game died (exit 0xC0000409, GMod's handler after the first fault). GMod's report: client Lua in
  `DrawModel` <- `addons/remixbinary/lua/remixlua/cl/cl_rtx_misc.lua:145` (the RTX fixes' wrapper of `DrawModel`) <-
  `mmdhl/props/render.lua:15` (the proxy's `ENT:Draw`, which `Entity:DrawModel` called on a drawn proxy) <- `:272`
  `drawPieces` <- `DrawAsset` <- `entities/mmdhl_prop/cl_init.lua:22`; its dump: the access violation at
  `studiorender.dll+0x6603b` from `+0x141b9`, `r14` 0, `r15` 0x388, a garbage `rbx` (`0x3b15a5be3c00`), as in the
  user's dump. With static props drawn directly, the same sequence at 2560x1440 (the preview painting too) ran to a
  normal quit. One earlier run of the published package did not crash in 155 frames of a preview that never painted.
- **The preview alone crashes it.** At 2560x1440, where the importer's preview paints, the previous package crashed
  the PoC 52 s into the session, while the preview showed the flower just imported: the same fault, `rbx`
  `0x18000000000` as in the user's dump (`r14` 0, `r15` 0x388); the fixed package ran the whole sequence there.
- **The importer's percentage in the game** is `library.progress`, the largest `progress` the worker's `status.json`
  reported (polled every 0.1 s): the published package's detailed import showed 65 % from 0.2 s to 41.3 s.
- **Seamless Portals took the same path** (2026-11-10, [portals-render-mesh-report.md](handover/portals-render-mesh-report.md)):
  the fixes part's portal drew its frame with `self:DrawModel()` from `ENT:DrawStenciled` through an
  `ENT:GetRenderMesh` that returned its cylinder mesh with its size as `Matrix`, re-entering `ENT:Draw` through a
  `draw_model` flag (`DrawModel` called outside the entity's own draw calls `ENT:Draw`). With the published package
  of 2026-11-10 (the Hotloader fixed, the portal not), `seamless_portals_remix 0` and `mat_queue_mode 2`, the PoC
  died about 2 s after a linked pair was spawned with `gm_spawnsent seamless_portal`: `studiorender.dll+0x6603b`,
  `r14` 0, `r15` 0x388, a garbage `rbx`. Drawn with `ENT:DrawModelMesh` instead, the same session ran 70 s with two
  pairs. Only portals the runtime does not render itself reach that code (unlinked, past its portal slots, or with
  `seamless_portals_remix 0`).

## VR V1: the Index, centre-view output and frame pacing (2026-11-10)

These measurements used the vanilla 64-bit PoC, `GarrysMod_PoC`, on the RTX 5090 (32607 MiB reported,
driver 617.42), an unworn Valve Index at 90 Hz, and a 1280 x 720 pixel desktop window unless stated otherwise.
The task reports retain the individual methods and receipts: [A](handover/VR-V1-A-report.md),
[C](handover/VR-V1-C-report.md), [D](handover/VR-V1-D-report.md), [E](handover/VR-V1-E-report.md),
[Q integration](handover/VR-V1-Q-report.md) and [Q review/pacing](handover/VR-V1-Q-review-report.md).
Evidence paths in this section are under the main checkout's ignored `out/`, rather than this document's
directory. Runtime file:line references describe the fork at `9d22eef6`, exported in this repository's
patch series through 0064. Earlier reports describe earlier binaries; their controls are identified below.
No acceptance run changed SteamVR's refresh or power settings, and nobody wore the headset.
In the tables, p95 and p99 mean the 95th and 99th percentiles respectively.

### S1: which Vulkan requirements must already be enabled when VR starts?

A queried SteamVR's lists and compared them with the published runtime's enabled-name log and the physical
device's offered names. SteamVR requested six instance names:

```text
VK_KHR_external_memory_capabilities
VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2
VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities
VK_KHR_surface
VK_KHR_win32_surface
VK_NV_external_memory_capabilities
```

It requested seven device names:

```text
VK_KHR_external_memory
VK_KHR_external_semaphore
VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore
VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation
VK_KHR_get_memory_requirements2
VK_KHR_external_memory_win32
VK_KHR_win32_keyed_mutex
```

The RTX 5090 offered all of them, but the published enabled list lacked the two instance names
`VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities` and `VK_NV_external_memory_capabilities` and the three device names
`VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore`, `VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation` and `VK_KHR_win32_keyed_mutex`. The AMD integrated
GPU also offered all seven device names. That first runtime enabled the five supported missing names at creation
(`src/dxvk/dxvk_instance.cpp:762`, `src/dxvk/dxvk_adapter.cpp:496`); its Vulkan 1.2 timeline feature was already
enabled (`dxvk_adapter.cpp:542`). Start checks the live requirement lists against actually enabled names
(`rtx_vr.cpp:230`), rather than assuming offered means enabled.
The second review found that `VK_KHR_get_memory_requirements2` still depended on the optional FSR DLL.
The current creation list ensures that name too: two instance and four device names independently of FSR
([ADR 0157](decisions/0157-steamvr-requirements-do-not-depend-on-fsr.md)). The five-name delta above remains
the measured difference on the installation with FSR present.

A's independent clear-colour Vulkan scene accepted 1418 eye calls over 8.002167 s, with 709 waits and zero
wait/submission errors, 88.601 waits a second including startup. This settles the reference contract, not
submission inside DXVK. Evidence: `out/vr/s1/extensions-final.json` and `submit-pose-final.json`.

### S2: can the runtime enlarge its output while the game window keeps its size?

C made the existing final output a centre image and substituted only the main camera projection. Its first
synthetic-eye run used 2016 x 2240 pixel eyes with 5 degree cant in each direction, a 2392 x 2456 pixel centre
and a provisional Balanced input of 1387 x 1424 pixels; 5831 cameras matched in 55 s with none unmatched.
Those were synthetic geometry tests, not the Index's actual transforms. An equal-extent control used a
2392 x 2160 pixel centre: the published flat runtime at that window size reached 128.15 frames a second,
and the enlarged-output runtime with a 1280 x 720 window and no submission reached 128.20 frames a second.

The real Index requests 2468 x 2740 pixels per eye at 90 Hz and reports an interpupillary distance (IPD) of
68.5366 mm. Its eye rotations
are identity, so the eyes are parallel, with asymmetric projections. The measured tangents are:

| Eye | Left tangent | Right tangent | Top tangent | Bottom tangent |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Left | -1.5383247137 | 1.0495523214 | -1.4038075209 | 1.4113825560 |
| Right | -1.0495594740 | 1.5419751410 | -1.4113649130 | 1.4066470860 |

The direction-only union covers 114.072 degrees horizontally and 109.363 degrees vertically. Covering both
translated eyes' corner rays at 0.5 m axial depth adds 0.0685366 to the horizontal tangent; at scale 1 this
changes the centre from 2944 x 2752 to 3072 x 2752 pixels, 4.35% more pixels. The accepted Performance preset
traces 1536 x 1376 pixels and still presents into the original 1280 x 720 window. The general coverage and
density calculation uses the full eye transforms (`rtx_vr_math.h:45`), even though this Index has no cant.
Q's captures contain the actual centre and both recommended-sized eyes; the plan's cant assumption is not a
measurement of this headset. Evidence: C's output controls and `out/vr/q/scale-100/captures/`.

### S3: can DXVK submit both eyes without an epoch race or a stalled pipeline?

The first C test let the game thread's WaitGetPoses start a new compositor epoch while queued render work
still submitted the old frame. It logged 139 failed eye calls in 6436 frames, all error 108,
AlreadySubmitted. Vulkan queue exclusion alone did not order these calls. A completion wait before the next
game-thread WaitGetPoses fixed the race: C's 185 s timeline run accepted and matched 8122 pairs, with zero
errors or unmatched cameras, 16606 compositor presents, zero drops and 8608 reprojected frames. Q's initial
scale-1 long run accepted 8557 pairs with zero errors, unmatched cameras or drops, 17131 presents and 8561
reprojected frames. Those are the serial control, not the final pacing decision.

The final runtime submits both eyes, performs PostPresentHandoff, then calls WaitGetPoses on the same
render-side command-stream thread (`rtx_vr.cpp:615`, `:625` and the call at `:555`). It primes the first epoch
there. The wait holds neither the request mutex nor Vulkan queue exclusion. An SDK-call mutex spans it so
`rtxvr_Stop` outwaits the call before revoking interfaces (`rtx_vr.cpp:87`). OpenVR has no cancellation for
that blocking API. In the final 310 s render-paced runs, the largest observed waits were 19.518 ms on
gm_construct and 36.912 ms on modern_house; a nonresponding SDK could take longer without an independent bound.

The module now calls GetDeviceToAbsoluteTrackingPose without waiting for render completion
(`vr/native/session.cpp:394`). Its prediction is time to next vsync plus vsync-to-photons plus measured
pipeline lead in refresh intervals (`:404-409`). Submitted pose timestamps are resolved against compositor
frame timing (`rtx_vr.cpp:590`); the first sample starts without a guessed lead. The game is paced by Source's
queue and DXVK frame latency. The final comparison below measured 89 frames a second on gm_construct at
90 Hz, without a module wait or a busy loop. V1 removed the serial completion mechanism and its timeout
tickets; the old packages and source remain only to reproduce the comparison.

### S4: can a pose travel through the material system's public call queue?

D's guarded experiment ran 120 frames in `mat_queue_mode 2`: 360 enqueue attempts, none accepted and no
callbacks executed. On this build, `VMaterialSystem080` GetRenderContext is Windows vtable slot 102,
RVA 0x1dd40; the live queued context's vtable is at RVA 0xb70a0. GetCallQueue is slot 145, RVA 0x1d6b0,
and returns context + 688 bytes (0x2b0). The returned object's first word was initially zero, then a pointer
to queue + 56 bytes, not a vtable. The hardware context returned null. The observed layout is a private
arena and cannot safely be called as the public SDK interface. The stock `materialsystem.dll` SHA-256 was
`6c9075c5384a1f9b99921928151a1d17b69faa81f1534e8f7c633a30fdb3e1ad`.

Production keeps threaded mode and a ring of 16 camera poses. It matches position and camera basis, with
0.5 game unit and 0.5 degree tolerances, preferring the newest equally good eligible pose
(`rtx_vr_math.h:151`). A later regression showed that an already consumed exact match could beat a fresh
camera moved by only 0.00001 game unit. Excluding consumed sequences fixes that frozen-counter path; its
CPU test requires the fresh camera to win. Evidence: `out/vr/d/s4/`, D's report, and runtime patch 0064.

### S5: what does an unworn Index do during a long active scene?

A ran a 600.006759 s no-submit scene and an 840.010121 s submitting scene, longer than the earlier suspected
shutdown interval. Controllers stayed asleep and the headset stayed unworn. The test used a standalone
clear-colour scene; builds and other desktop work overlapped it, so its jitter is not an isolated RTX cost.

| Measurement on the unworn Index at 90 Hz | Without Submit | With Submit |
|---|---:|---:|
| Active duration, s | 600.006759 | 840.010121 |
| WaitGetPoses returns | 53846 | 74763 |
| Returns per second over the whole run | 89.742322 | 89.002499 |
| Mean / maximum return interval, ms | 11.143214 / 958.356800 | 11.235776 / 285.658000 |
| Mean / maximum inside WaitGetPoses, ms | 11.068531 / 280.964100 | 10.566328 / 99.480200 |
| Invalid pose frames / wait errors | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 |
| Accepted eye calls / submission errors | 0 / 0 | 149526 / 0 |
| Standby activity samples / total | 593 / 597 | 831 / 835 |
| Compositor presents after the run | 53994 | 75625 |
| Dropped / reprojected frames after the run | 0 / 0 | 292 / 1700 |

Tracking stayed Running_OK (200), usually with activity Standby (3). No quit event arrived in either run.
The submitting run had a display disconnect/reconnect at 0.936 and 2.446 s, then 15 application-not-responding
events between 351.439 and 365.447 s, each followed by recovery. Zero API errors do not make this stall-free
rendering. SDK application GPU readings included a startup value of -18.606 ms; they are retained but cannot
measure path-tracing passes. The counters above are final cumulative values, because the initial query can
still name the preceding scene process. The compositor's own submits counter also advances without eye
Submit calls; the probe separately counts accepted eye calls. Evidence: `out/vr/s5/idle-no-submit.json`,
`idle-submit-14m.json`, their stderr and `summary.json`.

The proximity sensor was reported present, but its legacy button read supplied no state; the optional
display-suppressed property was unknown. Neither establishes whether the panel was lit. SteamVR's automatic
benchmark/window-geometry bookkeeping changed; the test did not overwrite it or alter power/refresh settings.

The earlier 04:02 shutdown was orderly. The preserved `out/vr/s5/vrmonitor.txt` records standby at
03:49:48.785 and ShutdownRequested at 04:02:37.168, 768.383 s later. `vrserver.txt:1387` records vrmonitor
PID 13080 initiating quit-all at 04:02:37.179; Steam records exit code 0. Steam's logs show GMod launches at
04:02:24 and 04:02:31 waiting on ShowInterstitials, followed by a successful launch at 04:02:40 to 04:02:42.
This supports a desktop launch/UI context but does not identify the initiating button or caller. No log
establishes an automatic 13 minute standby shutdown, and no compositor crash is shown. The exact action
cannot be recovered from these logs; `historical-shutdown.json` keeps the line-numbered excerpts.

### S6: does the wide view stay a main camera, with correct head motion?

The runtime uses the SDK-derived projection while the game uses a generous culling FOV. Simple 16:9 frustum
geometry needs 136.541 degrees of horizontal coverage for the union's 109.363 degree vertical extent; the
tested engine FOV setting is 145 degrees. C's 8122-camera timeline had zero unmatched cameras. Q's scale-1,
0.85, 0.7, heavier-map and
real-pose logs contained 73, 77, 81, 51 and 19 camera diagnostics respectively, all with cut=0. There was no
per-frame camera-cut/history reset in those runs. Those diagnostic counts sample the runs; they are not
their submitted-pair counts.

Image measurements on Q's gm_construct fixture found +20.236 and -20.303 degrees for scripted +/-20 degree
turns. A 0.2 m lean shifted a near feature 77.5 pixels against 76.294 pixels predicted. Matching painted
texture patches between eyes gave normalized cross-correlation 0.932 to 0.997 and near disparity about
0.0315 in tangent space, implying a depth of about 87 game units; far-building matches implied 1660 to
1754 game units. Log-depth PNG code 103 covers about 87.2 to 91.1 game units, consistent within quantization.
A silhouette midpoint is not a corresponding surface point between eyes; earlier exploratory estimates
using it are labelled invalid in `out/vr/q/feature-matches.json`. The PNG depth is not a float-depth truth.

E also found that real GMod calls CalcView before PreRender. Sampling only in PreRender had left the camera
one engine frame old. Acquiring once at the first callback fixed it: the final single-player/listen-host
stand-in traces had 775/846 camera pushes, zero duplicate pushes, zero engine-frame pose age and zero
render.GetViewSetup position error. The independently calculated camera error maxima were 0.000031457 and
0.000007629 game units. The camera anchor uses the engine-supplied predicted/interpolated origin minus the
current view offset, not a second GetPos sample (`vr/addon/lua/nlvr/client.lua:194`). A foreign caller that
explicitly invokes CalcView earlier can still choose that frame's first supplied origin.

### S7: what costs the frame, and which pacing holds the headset rate?

C's first real-eye profile, before the half-metre margin and fine command-list coverage, used a
2944 x 2752 pixel centre and 1472 x 1376 traced pixels. It reached 43.80 frames a second and reported
15.212 ms elapsed: 6.838 ms in the grouped path field, 1.915 ms in upscaling, 0.084 ms in the warp and
6.375 ms in Other; SteamVR's app GPU field was 17.375 ms. These are that early run's overlapping scheduling
and grouped metrics, not a later measurement of pure busy GPU work.

After the margin and fine profiling, C compared the same 3072 x 2752 pixel centre and 1536 x 1376 traced
pixels with serial pacing and without submission/pacing. The serial run lasted three minutes and used
83 logged profiles; the unpaced control lasted 100 s and used 92 profiles. It measured 44.91 against
101.62 frames a second. Covered application/SDK work was about 9.66 against 9.69 ms, the queue gap was
9.395 against 0.012 ms, and elapsed spans were 19.055 against 9.703 ms. Game work took 4.541 ms wall,
completion wait 9.071 ms and game-thread WaitGetPoses 8.615 ms. Actual CPU means were 4.602 ms on the game
thread and 3.392 ms on the command-stream thread. This identified the serial handover as the reference
scene's limit, rather than a GPU busy for the whole elapsed span.

Q's initial integrated scale tests used the serial mode and approximately 190 s active windows. All used
DLSS Performance, Ray Reconstruction and one to four bounces on the RTX 5090 and Index at 90 Hz:

| Scene / render scale | Eye size, pixels | Centre / traced size, pixels | Steady frames/s | Covered work + SDK, ms | Queue gap, ms | SDK reprojected/presents | Steady / whole drops |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| gm_construct / 1 | 2468 x 2740 | 3072 x 2752 / 1536 x 1376 | 45 | 9.404 | 10.485 | 50.00% | 0 / 0 |
| gm_construct / 0.85 | 2098 x 2329 | 2616 x 2336 / 1308 x 1168 | 48 | 7.345 | 11.467 | 52.47% | 2 / 2 |
| gm_construct / 0.7 | 1728 x 1918 | 2152 x 1928 / 1076 x 964 | 49 | 6.016 | 8.982 | 48.09% | 0 / 0 |
| modern_house / 1 | 2468 x 2740 | 3072 x 2752 / 1536 x 1376 | 33 | 14.219 | 6.566 | 82.83% | 2 / 119 |

The 0.7 row is `scale-070-r2`; an earlier console-truncated run is excluded. The house's 119 whole-session
drops include startup, captures and transitions. These rows explain the scale decision, but their pacing
has been replaced. Lower scale reduced work while leaving the serial handover, so its throughput gain was
only about 7% or 9%. Scale 1 preserves the requested density. C's fine profile and Q's initial 9.404 ms
profile differ because they are separate runs, not interchangeable estimates of one frame.

Q's corrected comparison then ran each mode for 310 s active, using the same timeline, fixed clear/noon
fixture and preset on each map, scale 1, 2468 x 2740 pixel eyes and a 3072 x 2752 pixel centre. The accepted
folders are `out/vr/q/review/construct-serial-r2`, `construct-render-r2`, `house-serial-r2` and
`house-render-r2`. The uncorrected attempts and the mixed 75 s pilot are not acceptance rates. Captures and
startup are excluded from each steady interval; `comparison.json` records its exact endpoints. No build or
Release gate overlapped these timing windows. Ordinary desktop and SteamVR processes still shared the GPU.

| Measurement at 90 Hz, scale 1 | Construct serial | Construct render | House serial | House render |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Steady accepted pairs/s | 45 | 89 | 33 | 33 |
| Whole-run accepted pairs | 13958 | 27358 | 10241 | 10253 |
| Whole-run compositor presents | 27933 | 27924 | 27974 | 27974 |
| Whole-run dropped frames | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Whole-run reprojected frames | 13993 | 729 | 23091 | 22987 |
| Steady reprojected/presents | 50.123% | 1.907% | 82.470% | 82.022% |
| Failed eye submissions / unmatched cameras | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 |
| Covered GPU commands + SDK intervals, ms | 9.694 | 9.238 | 14.384 | 14.448 |
| GPU-clock queue gap, ms | 6.847 | 1.948 | 7.070 | 7.684 |
| GPU elapsed span, ms | 16.541 | 11.186 | 21.454 | 22.132 |
| Actual game-thread CPU, ms/pair | 4.708 | 4.082 | 12.567 | 12.795 |
| Actual command-stream thread CPU, ms/pair | 3.385 | 3.018 | 8.072 | 7.722 |
| BeginFrame wall time, ms | 17.639 | 0.073 | 9.342 | 0.089 |
| Render-side WaitGetPoses wall time, ms | 0 | 8.093 | 0 | 10.421 |
| Game work between driver calls, wall ms | 4.590 | 11.270 | 20.961 | 30.189 |

Render-mode game-work wall time includes blocking in the engine/DXVK queue. Its 4.082 ms actual CPU work
within an approximately 11.270 ms frame and 0.073 ms BeginFrame demonstrate queue pacing without a module
sleep or spin. The command-stream thread uses 3.018 ms of CPU and mostly parks during its 8.093 ms SDK wait.
CPU running time is averaged across frames because Windows GetThreadTimes accounting is quantized at
15.625 ms. Compositor reprojected/presents is the SDK counter ratio; it is not `1 - pairs/s / refresh`.

The same comparison's mean fine times, in ms per profiled frame on the RTX 5090 at the dimensions above:

| Pass or interval, ms | Construct serial | Construct render | House serial | House render |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Preparation and acceleration structures | 0.353 | 0.351 | 0.548 | 0.554 |
| Path tracing, volumetrics and lighting | 6.467 | 6.082 | 10.832 | 10.878 |
| Demodulation | 0.040 | 0.039 | 0.052 | 0.057 |
| Separate NRD denoising | <0.001 | <0.001 | <0.001 | <0.001 |
| Composition | 0.322 | 0.317 | 0.367 | 0.365 |
| Upscaling with fused Ray Reconstruction | 2.068 | 2.030 | 2.148 | 2.160 |
| Post-processing and tone mapping | 0.274 | 0.267 | 0.265 | 0.270 |
| Both eye warps | 0.103 | 0.086 | 0.101 | 0.101 |
| Mirror | 0.007 | 0.008 | 0.008 | 0.007 |
| SDK Submit/handoff interval | 0.047 | 0.045 | 0.048 | 0.044 |
| Late raster | 0.013 | 0.013 | 0.014 | 0.013 |
| Capture and final overlay transfer, each | <0.001 | <0.001 | <0.001 | <0.001 |

The timestamp coverage distinguishes application command work, intervals inside opaque SDK calls and gaps
with no new application batch. SDK intervals can include host or IPC wait; they are not all shader execution.
The public GPU Total and Other include queue gaps. Ray Reconstruction denoising is inside NGX upscaling, so
the empty separate NRD bracket does not mean denoising is free. Per-capture `timings.json` and periodic
profiles retain the original coverage and sums.

The runtime also estimates first-display scheduling from the matched pose and compositor timing. These are
not optical or sensor measurements, and synthetic timeline motion has no physical angular ground truth:

| Scheduling estimate at 90 Hz | Construct serial | Construct render | House serial | House render |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Measured extra pipeline lead, refresh intervals, mean | 2.014 | 1.066 | 4.090 | 5.027 |
| Pose age at first display, mean / p95 ms | 45.751 / 48.868 | 36.076 / 36.305 | 67.210 / 80.566 | 77.390 / 82.326 |
| Prediction timing error, mean / p95 ms | 45.751 / 48.868 | +0.321 / +0.738 | 67.210 / 80.566 | -0.989 / +8.101 |

Serial scripted input samples at acquisition with no future offset, so its prediction timing error equals
its estimated display age. Render mode evaluates the timeline at the predicted target. Render-mode error
ranges were -10.071 to +24.589 ms on construct and -14.895 to +11.066 ms on house. SteamVR throttle samples
on construct were all 246 at one extra frame in serial, against 240 at zero and six at one in render mode.
House used one or two extra frames in both modes. The measured pipeline lead is workload-dependent; the
prediction code rounds and bounds the latest filtered lead instead of hard-coding one interval.

Render-side pacing is V1's only module mode. It removes the repeated half-rate handover on gm_construct,
with zero frozen-counter failures or submission errors. House's 14.448 ms covered work and 12.795 ms game
CPU each exceed the 11.111 ms native budget at 90 Hz; the compositor reprojects at about 33 pairs/s without
an error or stall. At unchanged size, 80 Hz gives derived budgets of 12.5 ms native and 25 ms half rate
(40 pairs/s). Construct's 9.238 ms work leaves about 3.26 ms of GPU budget at 80 Hz, while house still exceeds
it. No 80 Hz frame rate was measured. Native 90 Hz on the heavier map needs less CPU/GPU scene work; Auto
tuning remains V6.

### S8: can the wrist come from a game render target without taking the flat HUD into VR?

C first proved the Vulkan copy with a 1027 x 259 pixel source, then a 1029 x 259 pixel resize, and observed
242 texture uploads in its real-eye run. Q and E use the final exact 769 x 257 pixel canvas, 0.23 m wide,
attached to the left controller with a local 0.065 m offset. It costs 790532 colour bytes in Source, with
one allocation reused across starts and no render-guard refusal. A missing/asleep controller keeps the
overlay hidden until a transform exists, and disconnect hides it again.

E's real stand-in run painted health 87, armour 31 and pistol ammunition 18/256. Q changed those to health
63, armour 47 and ammunition 9/54 and captured the changed overlay, with zero texture or transform errors.
Five Q captures each had a 4231-pixel magenta witness in the desktop HUD and zero such pixels in either eye.
The world mirror matched the cropped left eye within 0.58 to 0.77 mean colour levels out of 255, against
34.6 to 56.8 levels for the right eye. In the final four pacing runs the largest world-crop mean error was
0.777 levels on construct and 1.889 on house. Images stayed upright, followed the scripted head and retained
the stereo disparity. Evidence: `out/vr/q/scale-100/captures/`, `image-analysis.json` and
`out/vr/q/review/image-checks.json` with the original captures in each run.

The runtime recognizes the exact target size and copies it to an owned overlay (`rtx_vr.cpp:660`);
the add-on checks the allocation and setup (`vr/addon/lua/nlvr/client.lua:169`). Ordinary 2D is drawn after
centre/eye output, and therefore stays on the desktop. The Source canvas and fonts stay cached until
process exit; SDK overlays, runtime images and session hooks end with VR. V2 must add interactive panels.

### Facts found while integrating and reviewing the game path

- The Lua API is available to every client script once loaded, including a server's client scripts. The
  removed Start keys are refused at `vr/native/module.cpp:81` by `lua_policy.h:9`. DLL and manifest discovery
  is module-relative. Capture/timeline names resolve under `garrysmod/data/nlvr`, unless the launcher sets
  `NLVR_TEST_ROOT` (`lua_policy.h:31`); Lua cannot choose that root. The PoC driver sets it under evidence
  (`tools/vr_session.py:433`) and collects images there. This is not authorization supplied by the page.
- Single-player pause stops CurTime and Lua timers, while the game continues PreRender. The page's poll uses
  RealTime (`companion/nativeloader/lua/autorun/client/nativeloader_vr.lua:11`). The native worker independently
  polls every 20 ms and acknowledges quit (`vr/native/session.cpp:249`, `:265`). In the safe PoC quit test,
  wall time advanced 9.713 s and CurTime only 0.00835 s before native cleanup completed. The event is supplied
  by the test timeline; SteamVR is not quit. The final shipping smoke also verifies native stopping/off
  cleanup when Lua has not requested Stop first.
- `fps_max` is on GMod's Lua console-command blocked list. E attempted a client console command changing
  60 to 90; the value stayed 60. `ConVar:SetString` rejects engine-made variables and works only for Lua-made
  ones: the test attempts on `fps_max`, `cl_drawhud` and `r_drawviewmodel` were refused. Direct console commands
  could change the latter two from 1 to 0 and back; production leaves them untouched. The driver sets a cap
  only in its process launch arguments, and the page explains a cap below the headset rate.
- Source console lines stop at 4095 bytes. An early scale-0.7 JSON record was silently truncated, so that
  run is excluded. `tools/vr_session.lua:38` emits ordered base64 chunks of 1600 characters; the reader at
  `tools/vr_session.py:221` requires every chunk, refusing incomplete, duplicate or malformed records. A
  three-second active-scene counter check also rejects a frozen eye pair even if its error count stays zero.
- The first known head camera is held through missing tracking/BeginFrame results; after 30 consecutive
  frame errors the add-on stops with the changed error logged. The page stops after 10 failed lifecycle
  polls. Start is disabled during Stopping VR until native off; the SDK must be released before restart.
  A recentre command relatches standing XY and yaw on the next fresh pose. Controller movement and turning
  remain V2. These fixes and the consumed-camera regression have native/Lua tests in the ordinary gate.
- The fixed preset is a fileless highest-priority layer (`rtx_vr.cpp:250`): DLSS Performance/Ray Reconstruction,
  one to four bounces, no frame generation, motion blur, chromatic aberration, vignette, free camera, camera
  shake or runtime present throttle. Live readback proved frame generation enabled before Start, disabled
  in VR and enabled after Exit, with the same upscaler/support flags. Fourteen real Source variables also
  matched. File configuration alone could not prove the live layered state. No `user.conf` was written.

Q's final flat-parity controls alternated three published and three VR-runtime sessions, 30 s timed each,
gm_construct at clear noon, 1280 x 720 pixels on the RTX 5090. Mean median frame time was 7.7627 ms published
and 7.7272 ms new (-0.0355 ms, -0.457%); mean p99 was 10.5634 and 10.5605 ms. Mean map-ready time was
24.100 and 24.567 s, with paired changes +1.3, -0.2 and +0.3 s. Full-image mean error was 0.77 to 0.97 colour
levels out of 255, world-region error 0.87 to 1.04. No VR module or OpenVR DLL loaded. These compare the
combined dormant changes, not one extension's cost, and do not prove zero startup overhead. C's earlier
two-pair control measured 7.507 against 7.573 ms (+0.87%); its earlier single pair measured 7.94 against
8.26 ms. Different control windows and mixed directions are retained rather than choosing one as universal.

With SteamVR already running, Q measured Start readiness at 2.67 s, median/p99 game-frame times
7.893/19.090 ms and a 281.503 ms maximum at the first resource transition. A held native fake initialization
tests responsiveness for 1000 ms; it is not a measured cold-SteamVR in-game startup. No-scene periods produce
no new eyes: SteamVR may retain, reproject, fade or show its dashboard. Fatal device loss/recreation was not
induced. True stereo, worn comfort, other hardware and independent panel/sensor latency remain unmeasured.

### The second runtime review: visible edges, queued cameras and recoverable failures

The second independent review read the runtime at `9d22eef6` and module/Lua at `dddbfe3`; its record is the
main checkout's `out/vr/review/independent-2.md`. The corrections and renewed evidence are in
[Q's runtime review report](handover/VR-V1-Q-runtime-review-report.md). Source references below describe
runtime `2cbf7f0d`, exported through patch 0070. Tests still use the RTX 5090 and unworn Index at 90 Hz;
the desktop fixture is 1280 x 720 pixels, recommended eyes 2468 x 2740 pixels, centre 3072 x 2752 pixels
and primary depth 1536 x 1376 pixels.

The old warp began at infinite depth and accepted the first self-consistent surface. At a foreground edge
that could be the wall, even where the eye's nearer hit was visible in the centre. The review measured the
modern_house lantern at about 285 pixels in the centre and 277 in each eye. Our check of the earlier
gm_construct capture measured the barrel at about 283 pixels in the centre, 270 in the left eye and 269
in the right. The strip grows with half-IPD times the difference of inverse depths: about 24 eye pixels for
an object at 1.5 m before a wall at 10 m, and 63 pixels at 0.6 m before a wall at 5 m on this Index.

The new search walks from the covered 0.5 m axial depth to infinity, linearly in inverse depth
(`rtx_vr_math.h:104`, `:113`). It tries both surfaces bordering an interval, refines their intersections and
keeps the nearest valid one within the depth already searched. This prevents a failed nearer candidate from
hiding a middle layer. An unresolved disocclusion retains observed background. Normal intervals follow the
depth texture's pixel spacing: the Index segment spans about 33 primary-depth texels, so it uses 34
intervals and 35 positions, with local refinement. A launcher can override intervals for a comparison;
normal rendering has no saved tap option. The CPU and shader use the same formula. Single-texel foreground,
mirrored edges, thin objects and three alternating depth layers are among 246 CPU assertions.

The first fixed-interval prototypes compared 16, 32 and 64 intervals. In post-capture windows on
gm_construct their warp brackets averaged 0.23, 0.36 and 0.73 ms; on modern_house, 0.24, 0.46 and 0.74 ms.
Those were separate 75 s pilots before the final two-surface refinement and depth-pixel spacing. Their short
windows and capture history do not establish the final frame rate. Two heavy-map pilots failed acceptance
with one and three unmatched cameras respectively, despite zero failed Submit calls. The raw failures are
retained. The final producer also latches its first overlay acknowledgement; the prototype had queried
native Info on every unchanged HUD frame. Final timings belong to the renewed runs in the report.

A queued camera can repeat one already consumed while a newer, different pose is pending. The ring now
distinguishes that known stale camera from a genuinely unknown one (`rtx_vr_math.h:195`); it repeats the last
image and counts the skip separately, while the plan's unknown-camera fallback remains counted. Eligibility
also requires a VR projection latched in that frame and generation (`rtx_vr.cpp:337`). The corrected
prototypes' first logged VR camera has FOV 1.90874 radians, about 109 degrees, instead of the flat 1.287
radians, about 74 degrees. The driver checks the first FOV against later fixed-projection camera records.

IPD events only publish a dirty flag on the native worker (`vr/native/session.cpp:281`); BeginFrame applies
the eye update under its own lock (`:402`). The worker can no longer make SetFrameCamera busy during that
update. The add-on holds the last accepted camera on a failed push, counts at most one attempt per engine
frame and stops only after 30 consecutive failures. It repaints the wrist until the runtime acknowledges
a texture, then stops polling Info for an unchanged HUD (`vr/addon/lua/nlvr/client.lua:118`). The error
result of that startup query is read too. Queue-mode and deferred-capture tests use process launch arguments.

DxvkError does not derive from std::exception. A shared resource boundary catches both and reports
RTXVR_E_RESOURCES (`rtx_vr_policy.h:11`), including eye initialization, overlay copies, capture staging,
colour views and timestamp allocation. Launcher-only fault probes throw the actual non-standard type at
the eye, overlay and capture sites (`rtx_vr.cpp:166`). A focus probe replaces successful wait results with
DoNotHaveFocus, exercising recovery on the real render thread. It does not imitate another application's
10 Hz SDK throttle. Focus loss skips output; transient RequestFailed is tolerated for five seconds;
incompatible errors fail immediately. Stop still outwaits the SDK-call mutex and has no independent bound
if SteamVR stops answering.

Only the published render context may observe overlay targets (`rtx_vr.cpp:750`); the swap chain's context
returns before reading the overlay map. Pacing flags are read under the request mutex too. Captures are
consumed at output, not at BeginFrame (`:607`). Closed timing records are bounded at 1024 even when no
frame is eligible (`:435`). New images begin UNDEFINED and explicitly transition to GENERAL (`:179`);
the strongest preset chooses TAAU when DLSS is unavailable. Wire API 3 adds two wait/focus counters:
StartInfo remains 168 bytes, FramePose 112 bytes and Status becomes 456 bytes. Both header copies are tested.

The console has two different limits. Printed lines truncate at 4095 bytes; Source's command argument
buffer is smaller, 512 bytes. A warning in the second allocation probe exposed the long server HUD setup
command, so it now travels as hex packets of 200 digits like the client probe. That run printed its Lua
boundary checks but no frame records and never exercised the renderer fault. It is a failed harness run,
not a passing allocation test; installation-stage and probe-ready markers make that distinction explicit.

The initial nearest-surface captures used runtime `2cbf7f0d`. Matching rows through the asymmetric eye
projections gives these widths, in pixels, on the Index at 90 Hz. The gm_construct barrel changed from
283.3 centre / 270.3 left / 268.8 right to 283.8 / 284.8 / 281.0. The Modern House target called lantern
in the review changed from 285.3 / 277.4 / 277.3 to 285.2 / 285.9 / 283.1. Both maps use the probe's
oildrum model. The new search restores foreground that was visible in the centre; a few pixels of depth
and reconstructed-colour boundary disagreement remain. Original-scale crops and per-row coordinates are
in this worktree's `out/vr/review2/analysis/final-r2`, with full captures in the main checkout's
`out/vr/q/review2/{construct,house}-final-r2`.

Renewed acceptance used 310 s on gm_construct and 120 s on modern_house. Both used the same fixed
clear/noon fixture and timeline, scale 1, DLSS Performance with Ray Reconstruction and one to four bounces.
Whole rendered/submitted/matched counts were 8401/8401/8401 and 1911/1911/1911, with zero failed Submit
calls or unmatched poses. Whole presents/dropped/reprojected were 21629/1269/18588 and 7928/481/7880.
The steady windows, after 60 s, reached 28 and 17 accepted pairs/s, with 83.8% and 100.0% compositor
reprojected/presents. The GPU already had 82% and 75% utilization respectively before the games started;
other programs continued sharing it. These loaded-host measurements do not replace the first review's
89/33 pairs/s with an isolated regression estimate. All runs keep their GPU/process context.

| Final mean bracket, ms per accepted pair on the RTX 5090 | gm_construct | modern_house |

| Eye warp | 1.977 | 2.651 |
| Mirror / SteamVR Submit span | 0.026 / 0.119 | 0.032 / 0.044 |
| Late raster | 0.016 | 0.017 |
| Covered commands plus opaque SDK span | 24.357 | 39.000 |
| Queue gap / total elapsed span | 10.899 / 35.257 | 10.543 / 49.543 |

| Render injection wall time | 25.54 | 8.99 |

The final warp means use 114 and 16 profiles. Preemption can extend a timestamp bracket, and the SDK
span is opaque, so these are not exclusive shader times. The old 0.11 ms warp and fixed-interval pilots
were different runs and algorithms; an isolated final-warp cost remains unmeasured. Capture/overlay
transfer means were below 0.00001 ms in these post-capture windows. The separate denoising bracket is
small because Ray Reconstruction runs within the upscaler. The report retains the full profiles.

Mean estimated pose age at display was 112.3/141.3 ms; mean prediction error was +15.0/+35.8 ms, with
95th percentiles +46.8/+58.8 ms. Measured pipeline lead averaged 8.54/11.34 refresh intervals. The module
caps prediction at eight intervals (`vr/native/session.cpp`), so this backlog can exceed its lead.
These are compositor scheduling estimates, not optical latency measurements. Render-side WaitGetPoses
reached 50.41/3.41 ms at worst; Stop outwaits its SDK mutex and has no independent bound if SteamVR
stops responding. No module wait was added on the game thread. At 80 Hz the derived native/half-rate
budgets are 12.5/25 ms; actual throughput at 80 Hz was not measured.
Holding the measured work/contention constant gives work-only ceilings of about 41/26 pairs/s
at 80 Hz (1000 divided by 24.357/39.000 ms). Queue gaps lower those bounds; these are ceilings,
not predictions of an actual 80 Hz run.

BeginFrame's whole-run means were 0.158/0.184 ms with zero completion-wait time. The legacy probe
field named wait_get_poses now measures the predicted-pose SDK query in render-side mode; its means
were 0.038/0.047 ms. It is not a second pacing wait on the game thread.

The final real-renderer fault probes threw DxvkError at eye, overlay and capture allocations. All
reported resource error 8 on the page and quit normally with clean restoration. Three injected focus
intervals were counted before 404 accepted matched pairs; a safe native quit then completed while paused.
Wall time advanced 9.436 s while CurTime advanced 0.0134 s. This does not simulate another application's
10 Hz SDK throttle. A final-runtime package without the optional FSR DLL accepted 810 matched pairs with
zero Submit errors and proved the library absent from loaded modules.

The normal package forces gmod_mcore_test 1. A temporary fixture omitted only that managed variable,
then launched --mcore 0. Automatic/default still resolved to mat_queue_mode 2; explicit zero was observed
as mode 0. Both initialized an unchanged wrist and completed all seven files of a capture requested
during a five-second interval without traced output. Mode 0 accepted 1846 matched pairs with zero
Submit errors. The files are acceptance evidence; its intentional gap is not a frame-rate control.

An initial flat-image comparison used flat-after screenshots, dispatched beside fixture cleanup;
these can show the restored camera with a different FOV. The active flat-before images agree. The repeat
also makes the flat-only view exclusive: GMod dispatches CalcView in undefined order and stops at a returned
view. The probe temporarily owns its table and restores it (`tools/vr_session.lua`), with call counts in
samples. The selected controls use -r3. Automated CreateMove pins angles and clears input; manual look keeps input.
The first construct acceptance attempt is likewise retained but excluded because its neutral yaw had
moved to about -54 degrees instead of the requested 180 degrees. A neutral-capture assertion now checks it.

Short arguments alone do not bound Source's whole command buffer. The first flat-b2-r3 attempt queued the
20 KB probe as hex commands, printed Cbuf_AddText overflow and a syntax error, then ran successfully on
retry. Its recorded Lua error correctly failed the run. The driver now uses acknowledged --lua stages of
at most 512 source bytes, with idempotent numbered fragments and exact UTF-8 reassembly. No game file is
loaded as probe code. The next run passed without the overflow; the failed attempt and rollback remain.

### Final second-review runtime: the first camera and lower-load acceptance

The final source is d29445c5, exported as patch 0071 after the earlier corrections. A physical look
exposed an initial flat camera despite the already correct 1.90874 radian projection. At consumed pose 0,
the rendered camera was at 823, -657, -40 GMod units while its newest published VR camera was at 764.846,
-659.314, -142.642 GMod units. The old manual validator did not check counters without a final-vr record.
The renderer now requires its first actual camera match (`rtx_vr.cpp:364`, `rtx_vr_policy.h:21`), and the
manual validator checks sampled counters. Later counted fallback remains ([ADR 0158](decisions/0158-the-first-headset-frame-must-match-its-camera.md)).
The neutral timeline's coincident flat/VR positions had masked this distinction. The reference has 249
assertions, including an offset first pose, and the driver has 16 cases. A real five-second metadata
mismatch withheld 505 initial cameras, then accepted 2014 matched pairs with zero Submit errors or unmatched
poses. The final canonical-package look observed 354 matched pairs, zero failures/unmatched poses and clean
restoration. A tiny client-Lua acknowledgement now precedes 512-byte source stages, each below 4096 bytes of
serialized console commands; the lost first-stage cause was not isolated from the busy client startup.

The final Index runs use the same RTX 5090, driver 617.42, 90 Hz, eye/centre/depth sizes and fixed preset
as above. The GPU was at 0% before gm_construct and 1% before modern_house, after the other work subsided.
They are the main checkout's `out/vr/q/review2/construct-final7` (310 s) and `house-final7` (120 s), using
the exact selected DLL before import. Rendered/submitted/matched counts were 26199/26199/26199 and
3782/3782/3782, with zero Submit errors or unmatched poses. Whole presents/dropped/reprojected were
27895/33/2582 and 10625/0/8680. Steady rates after 60 s were 85/30 pairs/s, with 8.59%/78.97% compositor
reprojected/presents and 31/0 steady drops. These are different runs from the earlier loaded 28/17 pairs/s
and from the first review's 89/33 pairs/s; their sources and host load are not interchangeable.

| Final mean bracket, ms per accepted pair on the RTX 5090 | gm_construct | modern_house |
|---|---:|---:|
| Scene preparation and acceleration structures | 0.350 | 0.561 |
| Path tracing and volumetrics | 6.128 | 10.705 |
| Demodulation / separate denoising | 0.040 / 0.0002 | 0.069 / 0.0002 |
| Composition | 0.314 | 0.316 |
| DLSS with fused Ray Reconstruction | 2.029 | 2.175 |
| Post-processing and tone mapping | 0.267 | 0.286 |
| Eye warp | 0.558 | 0.645 |
| Mirror / Submit span | 0.007 / 0.043 | 0.008 / 0.043 |
| Late raster | 0.013 | 0.013 |
| Covered commands plus opaque SDK span | 9.749 | 14.820 |
| Queue gap / total elapsed span | 1.954 / 11.703 | 9.416 / 24.236 |
| Game-thread / render-thread CPU | 4.269 / 2.937 | 14.214 / 8.513 |
| Render injection wall time | 10.675 | 20.052 |

Warp means use 349/28 profiles. Transfer work is zero or below 0.00001 ms in these steady windows;
Ray Reconstruction is within DLSS. Queue gaps and opaque SDK spans are not exclusive shader execution.
BeginFrame averaged 0.160/0.205 ms with zero completion wait. Render-side WaitGetPoses averaged
9.29/16.99 ms, with whole-run maxima 42.16/40.03 ms. No module wait or spin was added. The light map's
11.70 ms elapsed span exceeds the 11.11 ms refresh budget, so it reaches 85 rather than a full 90 pairs/s;
the house is bounded by its work, queue and CPU/SDK pacing. Stop outwaits the SDK mutex and has no
independent upper bound if SteamVR itself stops answering.

Mean estimated pose age at display is 38.31/82.20 ms, prediction error +0.13/-1.68 ms, and measured
pipeline lead 2.26/5.94 refresh intervals. Prediction-error 95th percentiles are +0.87/+11.25 ms. These
are scheduling estimates, not optical latency. At 80 Hz the native/half-rate budgets are 12.5/25 ms;
retaining the measured pairs-per-refresh cadence gives about 75/27 pairs/s (unrounded rates x 80/90).
That is a derived model, not an 80 Hz measurement or a promise that cadence will stay unchanged.

Final original-scale crops are in this worktree's `out/vr/review2/analysis/final7`. Matching rows through
the measured projections gives barrel widths of 283.8 centre / 284.2 left / 280.7 right pixels and Modern
House target widths of 285.2 / 285.7 / 282.9 pixels. The original losses were 8 to 14 pixels per eye;
small depth/colour-edge and disocclusion outlines remain. The final mirror world-region mean RGB error
is at most 0.71/255 and 1.89/255; every desktop witness has 4255 magenta pixels and both eyes have zero.
Queued and unqueued neutral wrist PNGs are byte-identical with 8223 bright glyph pixels; changed HUDs have
6962. The image checker rejects a blank canvas independently of file/counter presence.

The final flat control substitutes the published d3d9.dll into current package inputs. SHA-256 checks
prove all other 1784 archive entries equal; only the DLL and its manifest differ. Six 30 s runs alternate
published/final, under `out/vr/q/review2/flat-{b1,n1,b2,n2,b3,n3}-r7`, with Source FOV 90 degrees and the
same fixed camera/map/sky/settings. Neither openvr_api.dll nor gmcl_nlvr_win64.dll loaded in any game.

| Published/final pair on gm_construct | Map ready, s | Median frame, ms | 99th percentile, ms | Frames/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 23.8 / 25.6 | 8.245 / 9.127 | 12.363 / 14.881 | 119 / 107 |
| 2 | 25.9 / 24.4 | 10.012 / 10.007 | 14.030 / 13.980 | 99 / 99 |
| 3 | 24.7 / 26.0 | 10.165 / 10.323 | 14.479 / 14.420 | 98 / 96 |

The mean of medians increases from 9.474 to 9.819 ms, 0.345 ms or 3.6%; mean startup from 24.80 to
25.33 s. The first pair dominates the frame-time difference, whose cause is not isolated. Before launch
GPU utilization ranged from 0% to 22%; process/clock records remain. World-image errors are 0.68/0.65/0.64
RGB levels out of 255. These controls measure the whole final runtime change and do not establish zero
flat cost. Its exact startup work remains the six supported prerequisite names, copied enabled-name
sets, dormant CPU/container state, exports and inactive predicates/FOV bookkeeping. No OpenVR load/init,
VR worker, GPU image/query, preset or warp prewarm occurs before Start.

### Claude's check of the final build: a shared GPU, flat controls and the driver crash (2026-11-10)

Runtime `d29445c5` (`d3d9.dll` SHA-256 `e43aef99...`), package `0.0.0-vrq.runtime-review-final2`, against the same
package with the published `d3d9.dll` (`35ce5008...`). Evidence: the main checkout's `out\vr\q\claude`. Another
game (not Garry's Mod) used 11 to 25 % of the RTX 5090 during all of it, so these are numbers for a shared GPU.

- **VR at 90 Hz on a shared GPU runs at half rate, steadily.** gm_construct, scale 1, 310 s: 13,925 eye pairs
  rendered, submitted and matched; 0 Submit errors, 0 unmatched poses, 0 dropped frames; 27,938 presents of which
  14,022 reprojected (50.2 %); 45.0 pairs a second, the game's frame interval at two refreshes (median 22.2 ms,
  95th percentile 24.8 ms). The passes cost about a third more than on the idle GPU (path tracing 8.064 ms against
  6.128, DLSS with Ray Reconstruction 3.003 against 2.029, the warp 0.778 against 0.558, all passes 13.117 against
  9.749), which is over the 11.1 ms a 90 Hz frame has, and SteamVR then holds the application at every second
  refresh. Its own figure for the application's GPU time was 16.2 ms a frame.
- **SteamVR does not return to the full rate at the margin.** Scale 0.85 (eyes 2098 x 2329, centre 2616 x 2336,
  traced 1308 x 1168), 190 s on the same shared GPU: all passes 9.695 ms (path tracing 6.200, DLSS 1.937, warp
  0.527), SteamVR's application GPU figure 10.85 ms, and still 46.1 pairs a second with 49.7 % reprojected; 8,693
  pairs, none refused, unmatched or dropped.
- **Start VR took 2.98 s** from the request to the running state with SteamVR up; the longest frame of the session
  was 392 ms, at the start. Exit to "off" took 7 ms in the first cycle and 149 ms in the second. The flat frame
  time was 10.3 ms before the session and 10.0 ms after it (median).
- **Flat controls, 13 launches of each runtime** (`flat-*` with 30 s windows, `launch-*` with 15 s; gm_construct,
  1280 x 720, `fps_max 0`, `mat_queue_mode 2`, camera `823,-657,-40,0,180,0`). Valid runs: 12 published, 11 new.
  Medians of the frame interval: published 9.955 to 10.517 ms (median 10.189, mean 10.212, standard deviation
  0.213); new 10.008 to 10.738 ms with one run at 6.385 (median 10.124; mean 10.280 and standard deviation 0.243
  without that run). Start to map loaded: 25.45 s against 25.37 s. The difference of the means without the fast
  run is +0.07 ms with a standard error of 0.10 ms.
- **A single run can be far off without anything in the game differing:** the 6.385 ms run (157 frames a second)
  had the same camera and settings as its neighbours at 10.1 ms, and the worker's series had one at 5.080 ms beside
  8.1 ms. Over the evening single flat runs ranged from 5.1 to 18.6 ms with the load of other programs. Compare
  medians of several alternating runs, never one pair.
- **First screenshots of 22 valid controls:** mean absolute difference between two runs of the same runtime 0.622
  of 255 levels (0.477 to 0.801, 111 pairs), between a published and a new run 0.629 (0.288 to 0.769, 120 pairs).
- **The second screenshot of a flat control is not comparable:** the probe prints `NL_SHOT flat-after` and removes
  its `CalcView` hook in the same frame (`tools/vr_session.lua`, the `flat-control` branch), so the external
  screenshot shows the probe's 90 degree camera or the game's own view (75 degrees), whichever the capture meets.
  Three published controls gave both variants.
- **The driver crash at start-up is not the new runtime's.** `0xC0000005` at `nvoglv64.dll+0xe622f8`: one of 13
  launches with the published runtime (`launch-b02`, just after the map loaded), one of 13 with the new one
  (`flat-n3`, before the map; reading `0x300060059`). The PoC's own session records hold the same crash from
  2026-11-10T06:19Z, before any VR patch existed, with the same address and the same bad pointer
  (`native-loader\logs\sessions\2026-11-10T061918.168Z-34436-crash`). Earlier records of this address: R5 (2 of
  about 16 field starts), R13-A (2 of 8 PoC launches, each within a minute of another game's exit), R13-D, G1. In
  all of them another program was using the GPU or had just stopped.
- **Test windows take the keyboard from whatever the user is doing.** One control (`flat-n2`) ended with a normal
  quit (exit code 0, configuration saved) 15 s after its map loaded, not asked for by the driver; in `launch-n09`
  the Steam overlay ("Back to Game", "Exit Game") was open over the test window in its first screenshot. The user
  was playing another game during these runs. A run that ends like this is not a crash and not the runtime's.
- **`main` moved while the branch was open** (decision records 0152 to 0155): the branch's 0152 to 0154 became
  0156 to 0158, and four shared documents conflicted in the merge, all additively.

### The user's looks and the session tool's screenshot (2026-11-10)

- **The user's two looks were ended by the tool.** `out/vr/look/look-01` and `look-02` (main checkout): launched
  22:17:21 and 22:22:19 local, map loaded after 21.0 and 20.9 s, the game connected to SteamVR as a scene
  application at 22:18:48 and 22:22:49 (vrserver's log tail in each folder), and each run's `game.log` ends with
  `"failed": "screenshot failed: No module named 'PIL'"`, `"quit": "skipped after failure"`, exit code 1, finished
  22:19:23 and 22:24:18. The interpreter was `C:\ProgramData\miniconda3\python.exe` (`processes-before.json`), which
  has no Pillow; the agents' shells use Python 3.12 with Pillow 12.3.0. The look's probe printed `NL_SHOT look-ready`,
  `poc_session.py` imported PIL in `capture_window`, and a failed capture is a failed run there: the normal quit is
  skipped and the game is ended after `FAILURE_EXIT_TIMEOUT` (60 s). Both restorations verified clean.
- **A tool the user will run has to be tested with the user's interpreter.** `where python` in the agents' shell
  finds Python 3.12 first; the desktop app's terminal finds Miniconda. A virtual environment without packages
  (`python -m venv`) reproduces the user's side: the same look failed there before the fix and ran 171 s in VR
  after it (3,526 pairs, none refused or unmatched; `out/vr/look/codex-followup4-nopil-look-01`).
- **`Path.is_junction` needs Python 3.12.** The driver used it in its link checks; it now reads the reparse-point
  attribute from `lstat()` instead, so Python 3.10 and 3.11 can run a look.

## VR V2/V3 integration facts (2026-11-11)

- F's sync is 1467 bits including type; controller rays are Source +X after native conversion.
  Only the local single-player/listen host activates the dormant server stub. Current histories
  retain one second; client sync is once per tick, distinct from rendered eye-pair counters
  (`vr/addon/lua/nlvr/sh_protocol.lua`, `core/cl_net.lua`, `core/sv_core.lua`).
- H must call SetupBones before c_arms name discovery. Citizen hands have 43 total bones,
  19 retained / 15 finger joints per copy; unprecached client models can fail IsValidModel.
  RTX receives these opaque models in PreDrawTranslucentRenderables. Its 18-cm finger envelope
  prevents the palm-only test's measured 11-cm finger penetration. Q suppresses unresolved
  solid-start hands instead of putting a world model at the eye (`modules/cl_hands_pose.lua`).
- L's full-rate follow-ups distinguish same-frame room translation from deliberately buffered
  motor presentation. Server cumulative consumed/actual room receipts keep room input outside
  the non-room interpolation path. Raw frame increments must be compared with actual render
  intervals; a 66-Hz body path cannot be judged by a resting milestone (`cl_move_predict.lua`).
  Calibration leaves active Lua/native scales equal and flags the next-Start requirement.
- P applies force as impulse times dt, preserves natural ragdoll transforms, and uses native
  kit touch grants rather than duplicating inventory rewards. Supporting contact offsets plus
  0.2-s own-hand release grace avoid a proxy accelerating its own throw. Q's bare-punch cap is
  25 damage at/above the old 65-damage speed; held objects retain 65 (`sv_interact_math.lua`,
  `sv_interact_actions.lua`). Offline actual damage/cooldown and debug-identity regressions pass.
- A Source console line is bounded; full probe records use numbered base64 chunks. Runtime
  overlay PNGs cannot identify their purpose by order or extent: the capture request now
  records handles/roles. A black comfort image is meaningful while white glyphs are required
  for the wrist (`tools/vr_session.lua`, `tools/vr_session.py`).

Task reports retain exact earlier task-local measurements and their limits; Q's final report
will identify the combined candidate and repeat acceptance rather than mixing those packages.

Q property timing: the stock garrysmod/lua/autorun/properties/remove.lua:43 schedules entity
deletion with timer.Simple(1); the earlier statements disable solid/drawing for the effect.
A compressed fixture checking after 0.73 wall seconds falsely rejected a correctly dispatched
properties packet. Q now waits at least 1.27 seconds and retains both ray/hover and end state.

Q's integrated packet cadence: P's state and L's follow share the server's one-message-per-tick
slot (`core/sv_core.lua:71`). A one-tick presentation buffer produced held camera frames in the
combined run. `cl_move_predict.lua:32` learns a bounded 120-ms maximum from recent stamp gaps
and delivery age; `:46` samples the view trajectory without extrapolation. Accepted Index
motor intervals have 0.251/0.334/6.592% time-normalized spread and 70.46/70.45/72.29 ms mean
lag (walk/sprint/flight). The same-frame head ramps/sway remain within 0.000306 game units.
`sv_interact_math.lua:80` uses hand-minus-head displacement to cancel delayed common body
translation; integrated ledge and ladder pulls each rise exactly 12 units / 0.30 m.

The current engine exposes lua_dumptimers_cl/sv but no timer.GetTable. Q's flat-control timer
inventory therefore records the actual engine dumps after the timed window, preserving names,
source lines and raw remaining/repetition/paused fields (`tools/vr_flat_parity.py:18`). The
patcher's suffix is the patch ID's hex encoding, not a numeric instance (the packaged fixes'
`remixbinary/lua/patcher/sh_core.lua:80,163`); preserve it exactly. Published controls both
contain and omit the mwbase one-shot retry, so comparisons retain that measured control variation.

Q's canonical v2q.7 quiet Index matrix (RTX 5090, driver 617.42, existing 90 Hz) records
44.999/45.007 submitted pairs/s on Construct at 720p/4K and 29.903/29.933 on Modern House,
with 50.00/50.00/66.67/66.91% reprojected presents. Every steady row retains 2468x2740 eyes,
3112x2752 centre and 1556x1376 traced resolution. Covered command/SDK sums are
12.844/12.594/19.415/19.262 ms, not elapsed GPU spans (19.978/19.979/27.341/28.078 ms).
Near/far coverage+warp means are 1.171473/0.980818 ms. The cube's visible front is 0.2 m,
centre 0.214766 m; GPU minimum depth is 0.199991 m versus far 0.841826 m. Each sample has
25 one-second records and 12..19 covered profiles (`tools/vr_measure.py:21`, Q's report).

The real --look path passes in Q's fresh no-pip/no-Pillow venv: its five-active-second proof
snapshot has 205 matched submitted pairs, no Submit errors/unmatched/drops, followed by native
capture, ordinary demo_done/normal quit, SDK unload and clean restoration. This is a snapshot
counter, not whole-session throughput (`tools/vr_look_check.py:19`).

Q's final scripted-pose confirmations, combined-sim-12 and combined-index-07, each pass all
15 combined/accounting checks. Index counters are 5486 rendered/submitted/matched pairs,
zero Submit errors/unmatched/drops, 11715 presents and 6412 reprojections. CPU attribution
uses 5551 distinct game FrameNumber values (5551 PostRender calls) over 129.013118 s; server
uses 8430 ticks over 129.016428 s. Client hands/core/move cost 0.740295/0.759998/0.287110
ms per game frame; server interact/move/core cost 0.224273/0.033363/0.001853 ms per tick,
with quantized clock/wrapper overhead. Actual pose/control Lua sends average 65.342192/
65.016644 per second; these single-player engine sends are not NIC/UDP packets.

The initial full flat batch fails its predeclared cold-start bound (23.9 vs 27.3 s medians,
limit +2.39 s); steady intervals, screenshots and inventories pass. Median deployment is
16.4878/17.8530 s and elapsed after synchronous bootstrap 7.4521/7.9980 s, separate medians
which do not add to the median total. A fresh unchanged-limit replication follows space recovery.
Natural controller hand/aim alignment remains separate: the later C brief records that raw
identity poses hide the Index/Touch tip's roughly 40-degree rotation and wrist offset.

The fresh flat-parity-03 replication passes all unchanged bounds: frame medians 8.287/8.229 ms,
cold-start medians 25.2/24.4 s, paired RGB means 0.483..0.714/255 below 1.78709/255; exact
inventories allow only the dormant stub and measured published retry-timer variation. Actual
starts range 23.3..45.9 s. This does not erase the earlier +3.4 s startup-bound failure or prove
uniform cold/warm startup behavior. Both raw ten-launch sets remain in Q's evidence.


### Q3b: Source-time fixtures and background painted Derma controls (2026-11-12)

On the PoC's stock `garrysmod/lua/vgui/dslider.lua`, `OnCursorMoved` (81-109) updates SlideX/Y;
Think (168-172) only checks convars. An accepted VGUI press/capture alone does not prove slider
motion. verify2 combined-04 observes dragging and mouse-down true with desktop/gui cursor (0,0),
control cursor (-530,-324) and an unchanged value despite a moving VR ray. verify3 combined-05
corrects the local cursor to (229,19) but still gets no value change: the missing callback matters
too. The router now keeps canvas-local cursor reads and supplies an original captured-control
move only when native delivery is absent, with duplicate suppression. No stock code is copied.

Native timeline wall time can also advance across synchronous screenshot I/O while Source physics
stops. In combined-02 the crouch-hold, stand-up and toggle marks all read 76.7530463 seconds after
a 2.544-second gap, leaving crouch toggled and walking at 60 u/s. The same drift can miss a physical
death-ragdoll grip (combined-05: no buttons, surface 27.60 units away). Functional replay therefore
shares the physics clock; native timestamps remain in evidence and the temporal control keeps its
native wall clock. These failed receipts remain failed. See Q's report for the new artifact's final
measurements, which are never inherited from an older package.

The later verify4 combined-06 is incomplete after game PID 22984 exits 0xC0000005 at the
L-crouch capture (functional 74.2031 s). The source-clock ragdoll grab is observed, but heavy
lag is **2.31079 units**, still below >3; the offline ramp alone is insufficient to establish
native perceptible lag. Cause of the native crash is unestablished. Further sessions stopped
under the user's crash rule; no timing/CPU result is borrowed from earlier packages.


Q3b post-crash resumption: the one identical verify4 rerun passes L-crouch and quits normally;
Windows event1000 record39159 identifies the earlier PID22984 fault as client.dll+0x5744c.
No call/cause is established and no crash fix is claimed. On verify5, heavy250kg omega2.5/s,
a real grounded walking setup and unchanged >3 criterion yield 14.70221 units peak lag,
>=1.26 s above3, and static settling2.295 s. All36 measured walking-heavy samples are grounded.
The old arena's 24-unit no-clip clearance was unsuitable for a walking hold. Functional replay
now uses engine.TickCount times TickInterval, avoiding predictive client CurTime jumps.

The temporal probes' former rawget/rawset of CalcView["nlvr.core"] records nothing once the
core owns dispatch. Observing RenderScene records the actual returned scene without changing
ownership. Fresh temporal02 on verify5 has max head error .0006104 units, head/camera roll25,
command/player roll0, motor normalized spreads7.60700/8.68956/7.29902%, zero camera stop overshoot.
The keyboard's former timed targeting produced brel; keeping one cell through a single press/
release and waiting for actual field prefix produces barrel without retries or test-side SetText.

Balanced whole-frame CPU control on the same verify5 artifact: uncached/cached847/839 frames,
6.106110/5.884982 game-thread CPU ms/frame, resolver passes/frame6.74262/1.00238. Both realms
remain healthy; cache control changes only resolver invalidation. These current-package figures
replace no earlier raw measurement and do not use the combined alternating-frame estimator.


Q3c second verification: ULib Remove relies on Hooks[event] and indexes BackwardsHooks[event]
without guarding the latter; restoring an empty held compatibility table is required for Exit,
post-Exit Add/Remove and a second Start. Monitor-priority returns are ignored. Capability probes
must validate ULib's authoritative registry and short-circuiting, not only its table shape; Check
must also validate the live private dispatch entry. Faithful lifecycle/refusal/removal tests pass.
Held prop contacts need the same player-motion subtraction as bare proxies. Independent scratch
mutations now make both contact conversions and world-velocity Follow fail their regressions.

Native verify6 combined10 passes16/16 (physical32, movement36, UI12, review24). Heavy lag14.701903
persists continuously1.21499997 actual seconds above3; the new analyser requires >=1.0 continuous
second, rejects unobserved gaps >.30s and cannot pass a spike or disjoint bursts. Earlier2.94 is
not directly comparable: cadence .25->.03s and re-grounding changed the witness. Current omega
is2.5/s at250kg. Temporal03 instead crashes before map/console/probe Lua, PID11460,0xC0000005,
2026-11-12T11:59:50Z. Requested event1000 queries twice find no matching gmod event, so module/
offset remain unknown. Clean rollback is verified; no retry or new Release gate follows.


Temporal03 startup crash classification was subsequently established from its retained Remix
minidump reports-e946500f-f8a3-4b01-4cd9-5129d81218ab.dmp. Q's py -3 minidump parse confirms
0xC0000005 at nvoglv64.dll+0xe622f8 reading0x300060059. Claude classifies this exact signature
as the known intermittent NVIDIA startup-driver fault, also seen with published runtime (~1/13
launches during other GPU use); that frequency is his prior evidence, not a Q measurement.
Remix's own handler/dump explains no Windows event1000 despite WER snapshots disabled. The new
rule permits one fresh-folder retry of only this startup module/offset; other crashes stop.
Temporal04, the authorized identical verify6 retry, passes5/5 with3916 matched/rendered frames,
max head error .0006103516 units, motor spreads4.42891/6.57953/8.82669%, zero stop overshoot.


## Q4 VR integration observations (2026-11-12, branch-only)

- Noclip movers write a full head-space vector, so replacing command aim needs all three
  basis projections, not yaw alone (`vr/addon/lua/nlvr/core/cl_core.lua:281`). Four fresh
  Source flights with pistol aim +/-45 degrees and both dominant hands pass; sideways
  and vertical travel zero over 467.02--468.68 units. Evidence:
  `out/vr/v4q/flight-sim-02/flight-checks.json`.
- Passive Use previously bypassed P's control mask. Server `ClaimHand` / `RegisterReleased`
  are in `vr/addon/lua/nlvr/modules/sv_interact.lua:150`; Use honors both masks at
  `sv_interact_actions.lua:198`, and explicit external release grace is bounded to 250 ms
  at `sv_interact_physics.lua:204`. Ordinary thrown-prop re-grabs retain their prior behavior.
- The known w_physics emitter is its first attachment, without the name muzzle; W now
  selects that authored emitter (`sh_weapons.lua:17`). Both-hand model captures verify
  exported muzzle position to <=0.00354 mm at serialized precision. This is numeric
  registration, not physical measurement accuracy.
- Ten additional grip-region landmarks came from actual posed mesh vertices, independently
  of VR targets: `companion/tests/fixtures/vr_v4_weapon_grips.json` records selection and
  source hash. A model's bonemerge hand marker is a different rig landmark from the avatar
  wrist: crowbar 18.6119 cm and bugbait 16.4316 cm in `geometry-right-02`, while the chosen
  physical grips register within 0.00408 mm numerically. `vr_frames_analyse.py:37` keeps
  mount distance visible and checks the independent grip instead. Region uncertainty remains.
- The SMG muzzle marker is 2.91586 degrees from its mesh barrel in the combined witness.
  `companion/tests/vr_weapons_analyse.py:11` checks the independent mesh axis transformed by
  the actual model angle, retaining the 2-degree bound and reporting the marker separately.
- SDK tip and palm origins differ. Naive palm-angle test targeting hit panel V~.089 instead
  of .177. The private helper `vr_fixture_frames.lua:25` solves the actual tip ray while
  preserving palm position; both-hand tests and the fresh all-module session validate it.
- `integration-sim-02`: all 13 integration checks and five semantic reducers pass; 8940
  rendered/matched, zero unmatched/submit/Lua/module errors, normal quit/clean rollback.
  Physical pistol empty wait 5.24698 s; 79 counter matrices, max error 5.615 mm. Physgun
  yaw/pitch/roll errors 0.00257/0.06000/0.00272 degrees; push +4.97169 m / pull -5.00963 m.
  These are simulation witnesses, not Index throughput or CPU/GPU benchmarks.
- **Hard stop:** `combined-sim-01` PID49376 exited 0xC0000005 during active physics phase 11
  (`prop_door_rotating` fixture at `companion/tests/vr_interact_poc.lua:195`). Last active
  probe 49.3693 s, 3482 rendered/matched, no unmatched/submit errors. Windows Application
  event1000 record39236 at 2026-11-12T15:03:18.2813828Z names gmod.exe / module unknown /
  offset0. No matching dump was found in the run, PoC, Windows CrashDumps or Steam dumps;
  four older PoC dumps remain untouched. Cause undetermined; phase location is not causation.
  This is not the permitted NVIDIA startup signature. No retry was made; restoration is clean.

Accepted geometry, flight and all-module witnesses above use package v4q.3, GMA SHA-256
`6cd66136a9fdff0560a70b80d68cc6d1f605ba1c81ebd469ca17bd59fb8a148b`, product source
66ac316b; later observers/analyzers have separate identities. The independent stock-mesh
export uses diagnostic package .2 and has its own recorded source hash; its coordinates
are reference inputs, not transferred behavior/timing results. Earlier package measurements
were not transferred. The [partial report](handover/VR-V4-report.md) records every open gate.


Q4 crash review resumption (Claude/user, 2026-11-12) supersedes the unknown-cause stop
classification above. WER LocalDumps is configured to the legacy install's
`_debug_tools/hangdumps/wer/gmod.exe.<pid>.dmp`, newest ten retained by Windows.
Q only reads/copies this directory. Claude's retained dumps for49376,22984,50472 all
match gmcl_RTXFixesBinary_win64.dll timestamp0x6af185ec, return+0x41605b on the faulting
thread's stack, when RSP comes from the exception context. The reviewed chain is the
fixes R_StudioRenderFinal -> R_StudioSetupSkinAndLighting -> GetBoneCountForRenderable
on a freed queued-render client entity (prop_fixes.cpp357/265), not a VR defect.
Q's bounded parser confirms all three signatures; the22984 exception RIP itself is
client.dll+0x5744c. Eight initial classifier tests and the extended82-case shared-driver
suite pass. Receipts are in out/vr/v4q/resume/crash-*-reviewed.json; the original49376
run now also retains its WER copy and crash.json, preserving the earlier unknown receipt.
[Crash review](handover/VR-V4-crash-review.md) records the exact one-retry policy.

The authorized fresh retry combined-sim-02 (PID 50548) reproduces the same reviewed fixes
crash: exception RIP0, thread 53620, exception RSP 386895181112, return +0x41605b atRSP + 128,

remains the pre-existing fixes queued-render entity lifetime fault, not VR. The driver
correctly denies a further retry, preserves evidence and restores the PoC. No Index,
weapons-out CPU/GPU, flat matrix or Release gate followed this stop.


Independent review: Source HL2 ladder ascent uses movement forward/right vectors and
button intent, so vector rebasing of CUserCmd alone cannot isolate weapon pitch.
The shared SetupMove correction uses CMoveData:SetMoveAngles with level head yaw and
reprojected speeds/buttons, preserving command aim. References:
[Valve HL2 movement](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/src/game/shared/hl2/hl_gamemovement.cpp),
[Facepunch SetMoveAngles](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/CMoveData:SetMoveAngles).
Both realms' +/-45 tests check the native move basis separately from weapon command.
## Classic map mods as content packs (2026-11-12, Claude)

The user's request: package the classic install's finished Poolday and SafeHouse mods as `.gma` content packs and
check their look in the field ([ADR 0191](decisions/0191-classic-map-mods-ported-as-content-packs.md)).

- **Where they were.** `E:\RTX_c_backup\GarrysMod_RTX_c\rtx-remix\mods`: `Poolday` (69 files, 353 MB: 20 material
  overrides, 4 light and 1 empty mesh override, its own copies of four Aperture MDLs), `Poolday_mirror_fix` (the
  mirror on `mat_9F7C9DBBFC6DCB39`, made opaque, metallic 1, roughness 0, decal category cleared; category fixes on
  two meshes), `gmodrtx_poolday_fix` (translucent water on `mat_645A5581E6491CF0`, the RTX fixes' water stand-in),
  `SafeHouse` (223 files, 2.82 GB: 60 material, 23 mesh and 31 light overrides, 13 Poly Haven models as binary
  crate `.usd` layers, 20 ambientCG texture sets, 22 upscaled textures). The field's hand-placed copies of the three
  Poolday folders were byte-identical to the backup's.
- **The maps.** 3096281917 "New-Pool-Day-2 from CS 1.6": `temp.gma` with `maps/gm_new_pool_day2.bsp` (12.5 MB;
  14 `info_player_start`, 19 `light`, 138 `info_node`). 944959992 "Safehouse (CSGO)": a legacy LZMA
  `843710577598652974_legacy.bin` (51.4 MB; 5 property bytes, an 8-byte size, a stream without an end marker, so
  `lzma.decompress(format=FORMAT_ALONE)` fails and `LZMADecompressor(FORMAT_ALONE).decompress` works) holding
  `maps/gm_csgosafehouse.bsp` (162 MB, content packed in; 140 `prop_dynamic`, 316 static props, CT and T spawns
  only).
- **How the runtime picks a hash's replacement** (the runtime fork, `src/dxvk/rtx_render`):
  `AssetReplacer::getReplacementMaterial` (`rtx_asset_replacer.cpp:110`), `getReplacementsForMesh` (`:36`) and
  `getReplacementsForLight` (`:97`) return the first mod, in the mod set's order, that has the hash, whole.
  `UsdMod::Impl::processReplacement` (`rtx_mod_usd.cpp:1395`) registers nothing for a mesh prim without content,
  categories or particle system. `ModManager::enumerateModsInDir` (`rtx_mod_manager.cpp:178`) looks for `mod.*`
  only in each folder directly under `rtx-remix\mods`, so a `mod.usda` one level deeper is a plain layer. A
  merged mod's sub-layer folders each become an asset search path (`Adding asset search path: ...\pool_day_rtx\poolday\`).
- **What the merge changed: nothing.** Of the Poolday folders' hashes, two are in two folders:
  `mat_3C0A7FF562C52317` (Poolday sets `metallic_constant` 0 and `reflection_roughness_constant` 1, the mirror fix 0
  and 0.5: Poolday's win either way) and `mesh_345F539D9A62C372` (empty in Poolday, so the mirror fix's
  `decal_Static = 0` was live and stays live).
- **Shared hashes on the user's machine.** Safehouse shares 8 stock prop textures with three remasters:
  `447019A4055FFB5F` (riverbed rock) with `gm_br_rtx` and `gm_br_rtx_pitfalls`; `2ADC3D568E4FC770`,
  `705B56FA97CD4184`, `8822F4EAC3A55112`, `A64554C46626C038`, `B31128A9FC78C3A4`, `D9284127635ADFCB` (bark, door,
  dish soap, wood furniture, patio chair, bed) with `gm_brmovie_complete_rtx`; `45B2961184E5A854` (kitchen sink) and
  `8822F4EAC3A55112` with `modern_house_rtx`. Pool Day shares none.
- **Poolday's dangling references.** 39: 20 metallic maps in a `metallness/` folder the mod never had, 7 height,
  6 normal and 6 roughness maps; Remix logged each as an `err:` (R19's count of 39). Remix also warns that several
  Poolday DDS files have no mips ("suboptimal replacement texture").
- **A binary crate layer's references** are its `TOKENS` section's path-like tokens: header `PXR-USDC`, version
  0.8.0, a table of contents at the offset in bytes 16-23, the section holding the token count, the raw and the
  compressed size, then `TfFastCompression` (a chunk-count byte, then LZ4 blocks). Read in Python, no `pxr`
  (`skills/workshop-content-pack/scripts/usd_refs.py`): all 16 Safehouse layers in 0.4 s.
- **The field check collided with the VR labs.** The first field run quit 75 s into the start (exit 1, no dump)
  when the VR V4 Codex drivers quit the field game before their PoC run; they take `out\r10\poc.lock` first, so the
  next run held that lock.
- **Pool Day in the field** (2026-11-12, loader 0.16.0, RTX package `0.0.0-dev.20261112034453+d568f6e1`, the pack
  as a local archive, the hand-placed copies moved out): 10 views spread over the map's AI nodes, each with the
  pack and with `rtx.enableReplacementMaterials`/`Meshes`/`Lights` off. The pack changed every view (mean
  absolute difference 10.0-30.2 of 255 at 960 px). 19 of its 22 texture hashes were drawn: 18 `fnpd2/*` and
  `halflife/*` materials packed in the map, and the glass `9F7C9DBBFC6DCB39` as the map's cubemap copy
  `maps/gm_new_pool_day2/halflife/glassblue1_-187_79_266`, now a mirror. Not drawn: the water stand-in
  `645A5581E6491CF0` (RTX Water printed "6 water faces ... native core": it owns the water) and two plain 512 px
  textures (`74B977689DD879A4`, white; `BBB7C7E9375B91F9`, black). The loungers (`fnpd2/chair`) are solid
  plaid slabs: the mod's 4096 plaid albedo has alpha 255 everywhere, so the stock texture's see-through slats
  fill in. The game quit normally.
- **Safehouse in the field** (same setup, `-noworkshop`, the legacy item mounted through `steamworks.DownloadUGC`):
  21 views at the pack's furniture, lamps and yard. The first run's machine stopped with a kernel bugcheck after
  its fifth view (the last five of its shots were left damaged on disk); the remaining 16 views and the hash probe
  ran in a second session. The pack changed every view (11.6-52.6 of 255). 59 of its 60 texture hashes were
  drawn (not seen: `E036831AC1F90094`); the 13 Poly Haven models replace the stock props (sofa, armchair,
  cabinets, stove, tea set, bust), so its mesh hashes match the current runtime too, and its light overrides
  light the yard at night. Two looks are the mod's own choices: the table lamps (`lamp_table02`) are replaced by
  the marble bust, which leaves that bedroom darker, and the shared riverbed rock shows `gm_br_rtx`'s version,
  which sorts first on the user's machine.
- **Putting the field back**: the original `config.json`, the hand-placed Poolday folders, then `nlctl apply`
  removed the two packs' 296 files (generation 17, 358 file-system changes).

The water-lag interpretation is supported by Valve's public
[Source SDK WaterMove](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/src/game/shared/gamemovement.cpp#L1272):
it retains velocity, applies friction, then accelerates toward the desired direction.
Interpreting the measured phase lag as this response in GMod261112 is an inference,
not a claim that its binary is byte-identical to that SDK. The3degree physical and
.2degree command-direction limits remain separate and unchanged.
## "Loading enhancements": what the runtime's mod load spends its time on (2026-11-12, Claude)

The user's report: "The field game takes a long time to load enhancements each start" (the box at the menu's bottom
left, "Loading enhancements" over "Processing Materials (496 processed)"). Fixed by runtime patch 0086
([ADR 0195](decisions/0195-the-mod-loader-keeps-its-texture-reads-between-starts.md),
[report](handover/mod-load-cache-report.md)). Line numbers are the runtime tree at `c6b48ed1` with patches 0001-0071.

- **The box is the runtime's own.** `dxvk_imgui.cpp:1458` adds the HUD message "Loading enhancements" while any mod
  is in `OpeningUSD` or `Processing*`; the second line is `Processing Materials (N processed)` (`:1427`), with N
  updated every 16 materials (`rtx_mod_usd.cpp:2017`), one line per loading mod up to four. Patch 0001's
  `rtx.gui.enhancementLoadingMessageDelayMilliseconds` (1500) keeps it off screen for a load shorter than 1.5 s.
  No package Lua or add-on is involved.
- **When the load runs.** `RtxInitializer` starts a thread `rtx-initialize-assets` (`rtx_initializer.cpp:176`) that
  waits for `libcef.dll` to be mapped plus 2 s (`waitForEmbeddedChromium`, `:57`, GMod's menu browser), then
  `AssetReplacer::initialize` (`rtx_asset_replacer.cpp:124`) loads the mods in `rtx-remix\mods` one after another.
  The menu needs none of them; a map started before they finish draws without its replacements until they do.
- **What a mod's load does per texture reference** (`processMaterial` → `getTexture`): USD resolves the asset path
  (a file existence check); `AssetDataManager::findAsset` (`rtx_mod_usd.cpp:673`) makes a new `DdsTextureData`
  whose `load()` (`rtx_asset_data_manager.cpp:231`) `fopen`s the file, reads its headers and calls
  `last_write_time` (`:240`); `preloadTextureAsset` (`rtx_mod_usd.cpp:678`) then makes the texture with
  `requestMips(1)` and `scheduleTextureLoad(texture, false)` (`rtx_texture_manager.cpp:2046-2047`), which stages the
  `kMipLevelsToCache` = 5 smallest mips synchronously on the loading thread: `DdsTextureData::data()` opens and maps
  the file a second time (`rtx_asset_data_manager.cpp:160`), `releaseSource()` closes it (`rtx_texture_manager.cpp:289`).
  A file named by several materials is parsed for each (the texture itself is shared by its name's hash).
  Nothing is kept between starts. The texture's hash is its file name's, not its content's.
- **The field's mods** (2026-11-12, read from the folders only): 28 mod folders, about 7,300 material prims, 25,487
  texture references to 16,700 distinct DDS files (about 70 GB). Two pairs load the same content twice:
  `gm_brmovie_complete_rtx` and `gm_brmovie_complete_rtx_pack` (2,452 references each), `blood_overhaul_rtx` and
  `nl_blood_overhaul_rtx`. The busiest: `gm_korolevskiy_theater_rtx` (5,340 references to 513 files),
  `gm_cathedral_of_mercury_rtx` (4,086 to 680), `gm_br_rtx` (3,684). H: is a Samsung 980 PRO (NVMe).
- **Measured in the PoC** (`tools/qa/mod_load_session.py`, the user's 12 subscribed content packages deployed:
  19 mods, 17,970 references to 9,042 files; `-noaddons -noworkshop`, gm_construct, 1600x900). Before (patch 0086's
  timing lines on the old loader): **27.3 s** at the first start after the content was unpacked (24.0 s of it in
  `findAsset`), **1.83 s** at the next (warm), **11.5 s** after `purge_file_cache.py` emptied Windows' file cache of
  the mods (8.2 s in `findAsset`, 1.5 s staging). The published package, timed from its log markers in an earlier
  series: 5.9 s at its first start after the unpack and 1.7 s at the next; so the first opens of freshly unpacked
  files vary widely (5.9 to 27.3 s), the warm load does not. With the cache: **10.8 s** at the first, cold start (the cache made,
  35 ms to write 19 files, 7.2 MB), **1.09 s** warm and **1.36 s** cold with the cache: every one of the 9,042 files
  a hit, none opened, `find` 76-81 ms (the folder listings 11-16 ms, the cache files' read 36-38 ms). What remains is
  USD: the stages (0.22-0.24 s), the path resolution (0.23-0.39 s) and Safehouse's meshes (0.29 s). The material walk
  itself fell from 10.9 s (cold) to 0.78 s.
- **Fresh files are slowest.** The first open of a just-written DDS file cost about 4 ms (`gm_br_rtx_complex`: 1,752
  files, 7.6 s of `find`), a file the file cache had lost about 0.9 ms, a warm one about 0.06 ms. Windows Defender scans a
  file at its first open after a change, which fits the first figure; not measured separately (no administrator
  rights to change it).
- **Emptying the file cache without administrator rights**: opening a file with `FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING` purges its
  cached pages (NTFS flushes and purges the data section when nothing maps it). 3,000 files of 64 KB: a tail read of
  each took 0.072 s warm and 0.39 s after the purge (`tools/qa/purge_file_cache.py --check`).
- **`RtxFileSys::rootPath()` is the executable's folder** (`util_filesys.cpp` `lazyInit`: `bin\win64` for GMod),
  while the default mods, captures and logs folders come from `absolute(".")` at the DLL's static initialisation,
  the game's working folder (`util_filesys.h` `s_pathSpecs`). A path built on `rootPath()` lands in
  `bin\win64\rtx-remix`; the cache is put beside the mods folder.
- **A folder listing gives every stamp at once.** `GetFileInformationByHandleEx(FileIdBothDirectoryInfo)` on a folder
  handle returns each entry's size, last write time, change time and 64-bit file id, about 1,800 files in 2-5 ms. NTFS
  updates a folder entry's copy of these when the file is closed, and for a file with several hard links only in the
  folder it was written through; `GetFileInformationByHandle` on a handle opened with `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES` alone
  reads the file's own record (link count, index, size, times) without a data open.
- **Seen in the PoC runs, not caused by the mods:** after creating its swap chain the game sometimes waits 8.6-12.7 s
  before its first frame (`[D3D9WindowProc] Swapchain handle is invalid` to the first `SetRenderState`): at every
  first start after a package change and in the instrumented series' later starts, never in the published package's
  or the fix's later starts. It comes before the mod thread starts, so it is not part of the mod load; a driver
  pipeline cache miss is the likely cause (not investigated). Every run printed one Lua error,
  `Couldn't include file 'nativeloader\engine_guard_words.lua'`, the published package included.

## VR motion on V4's coalesced wire (2026-11-12, Claude)

- **What the motion check measures.** `vr_move_motion_probe.lua` records the origin `RenderScene` receives each frame
  (the VR camera) beside `LocalPlayer():GetPos()` and the core's feet; `vr_move_motion_check.py` divides each camera
  step by its frame interval and requires the 5-95 % spread of those normalized steps to stay at or below 10 % for walk,
  sprint and flight. The V2/V3 package passed it at 0.6, 0.5 and 1.5 % (`allmotion-sim-04`, 2026-11-11).
- **V4's numbers.** The final package (`v4final.1`, PoC 261112, simulated, 90 Hz renders with a mean frame of 11.1 ms)
  gave 13.1/25.4/21.8 % and, rerun, 17.5/46.3/21.7 %; the engine's own position moved smoothly throughout. Every render
  had a fresh VR frame sequence, so the native pose path is not the cause.
- **The cause.** `cl_move_predict.lua` follows FOLLOW stamps a learned buffer behind them. On V4's shared wire FOLLOW
  rides with the hands' packets, every three to five ticks, and the buffer moved between 15, 45, 60, 75 and 90 ms
  (75 ms in 1,278 of 1,923 frames). The six camera stalls of the first run all fell on a 60 -> 75 ms change: the target
  moved back a tick and the cursor, which never retreats, held for a frame (then a half step). Every reset of the
  trajectory (generation, mode, 0.3 s without FOLLOW) also put the buffer back to one tick: the first frames of each
  segment then alternated between zero and catch-up steps while the cadence was relearned.
- **The fix** ([ADR 0196](decisions/0196-vr-motion-keeps-the-wires-cadence.md)) keeps the cadence across resets and
  eases changes of up to 1.5 ticks at 5 % of the motor clock. With that alone the next run had no stall but 11-13 %
  spread: the buffer still changed 3-6 times per 1.4 s window, and easing at 5 % is itself a 10 % band. A two-second
  hold gave walk 11.1, sprint 4.1 and flight 8.5 % with no stall; the walk's one remaining change and paired frame-time
  outliers (a 13-18 ms frame then a 7-10 ms one with equal camera steps: the probe's `RenderScene` time jitters against
  the view call's motor time) made up the rest. The final rule eases at 2.5 % and holds for ten seconds; the PoC result
  is in the V4 report.

## VR quality and stereo in the runtime (2026-11-13, Claude, for V6 and V7)

- **Why Lua could never move VR quality.** The VR preset is an option layer `{0xFFFFFFFF, "! VR session"}` built in
  `RtxVr::initialise` (`rtx_vr.cpp:372-382` before patch 0087). Layers sort by priority and then by name
  (`rtx_option_constants.h:154-165`), so at the same priority it also wins over "Quality Presets". Lua's only route
  to options, the fixes' `RemixConfig.SetConfigVariable` -> `remixapi_SetConfigVariable`
  (`rtx_remix_api.cpp:1776-1806`), writes the User layer (`0xFFFFFFFE`), which every key in the session layer
  outranks. `RtxOption::setDeferred(value, layer)` (`rtx_option.h:414`) takes an explicit layer, which is how patch
  0087 writes the session layer from the render thread.
- **What a quality change recreates.** The DLSS mode changes the traced size every frame through
  `setDownscaleExtent` (`rtx_context.cpp:249-296`), which recreates the ray-tracing outputs when the size changes
  (`rtx_context.cpp:409-415`); the centre size already followed IPD changes (`rtxvr_UpdateEyes`). Only the eye
  images were allocated once per session (`rtx_vr.cpp:383-385`).
- **One view per frame, everywhere.** `Resources` is one member of `DxvkObjects` and is reached only through
  `getResources()` (38 uses in `rtx_render`); the main camera only through `SceneManager::getCamera()` (40 uses). The
  frame number is `QueuePresentCount` (`dxvk_device.cpp:363-367`) and keys TAA parity, RTXDI's reservoir page, the
  "written last frame" stamps (`rtx_resources.cpp:323-326`), `RtCamera::update`'s guard (`rtx_camera.cpp:638-640`)
  and NRD's `frameIndex`. DLSS and DLSS-RR are one NGX feature each and never set the SDK's subrect fields
  (`rtx_ngx_wrapper.cpp:693-709, 855-878`); NRD takes one matrix pair per instance and its `rectOrigin` shifts
  only the guides, behind `NRD_USE_VIEWPORT_OFFSET` in a prebuilt DLL (`NRDSettings.h:166-169`). A double-wide
  picture would touch 143 `cb.camera` uses in 35 shader files and eight spatial filters across the seam; that is
  why V7 swaps per-eye state instead ([ADR 0198](decisions/0198-vr-true-stereo-by-swapping-the-eyes-state.md)).
- **The Index here** reports 90 Hz and, with SteamVR's own resolution at 150 % (`gpuSpeedRenderTargetScale` 1.5 in
  `steamvr.vrsettings`), a recommended 2468 x 2740 per eye.
- **The ladder on the Index at 90 Hz** (V6 run `out/vr/v6/quality-index-01`, PoC `gm_construct`, warp mode): steps 1
  to 3 (`full`, `high`, `balanced`, DLSS Performance) held 45.0 fps, SteamVR's half rate; steps 4 to 7 (DLSS Ultra
  Performance, scale 0.8 to 0.5) ran at 78 to 90 fps. The same steps in the simulated headset ran at 78 to 91 fps
  with the top step's GPU work at 12.3-12.7 ms (path tracing with volumetrics 7.5 ms, upscaling 2.4 ms).
- **The frame's GPU span is not its work on a headset.** On the Index `gpuMsTotal` filled the frame interval at every
  step (21.9-23.2 ms at 45 fps, about 11 ms at 90 fps, even at the floor, whose work is under 5 ms): the profile's
  `gpu_queue_wait_cpu_ms` (the span not covered by this context's recordings, `profileJson` in `rtx_vr.cpp`) was
  6-10 ms of each 45 fps frame, while the passes' covered work at step 3 was 12-17 ms (path tracing 9.7 ms there,
  against 7.5 ms at the top step in the simulation: the compositor's Motion Smoothing shares the GPU). Patch 0088
  reports the work as `gpuMsWork` ([ADR 0201](decisions/0201-vr-auto-reads-the-gpus-work.md)).
- **SteamVR's half-rate lock wobbles and lingers.** At steps that cannot make 90 Hz the Index ran at 44.1 to 45.1
  frames a second per one-second window (a 0.99 keep ratio of 45 is 44.55, which half the windows missed), and
  the lock outlives the step that caused it: step 4 measured 85 fps in one run and 44.6 in the next, right after
  step 3. The GPU's work at the top step was 16.1 ms there (`out/vr/v6/quality-index-02`).
- **What a second view must own** (surveyed for V7, ADR 0202). Only five passes keep per-view history outside
  `Resources`: ReSTIR GI's reservoirs and last composite (`rtx_restir_gi_rayquery.h:144-150`), DLSS-RR's NGX feature,
  the NRC context and SHaRC; RTXDI's reservoirs are in `RaytracingOutput` (`m_rtxdiReservoirBuffer`). Every `RtxPass`
  registers its frame and resize events with `getCommon()->getResources()` in its constructor
  (`rtx_resources.cpp:1674-1680`), so a pass made while an eye's state is selected follows that eye. `Resources` also
  keeps the frame's TLAS, noise, white texture, sky probe and matte. The froxel integration reads only
  `cb.volumeArgs.cameras` (`volume_integrate.slangh:43`), never `cb.camera`; the aerial perspective lookup maps a
  pixel's screen UV through `forward + right * x + up * y` (`atmosphere_common.slangh:2329`), so an off-centre frustum
  is the same formula with forward shifted; the cloud history is per pixel at `cb.camera.resolution`
  (`geometry_resolver.slangh:2250`). The NRC SDK's `nrc::vulkan::Initialize` is process-wide and every
  `NrcContext` destructor called `Shutdown` (`rtx_nrc_context.cpp:123-137`); a failed activation sets
  `integrateIndirectMode` to importance sampling for everyone (`rtx_neural_radiance_cache.cpp:853-863`). The package's
  `classic_remix_defaults.conf` selects NRC (`rtx.integrateIndirectMode = 2`) and the physical sky (`rtx.skyMode = 1`).
- **True stereo's cost**, top step: on the Index (`out/vr/v7/stereo-index-01`) the GPU's median work 13.5-14.7 ms
  warped and 17.0-17.5 ms with each eye traced (1.19 times), both holding SteamVR's 45 fps; simulated
  (`out/vr/v7/stereo-sim-01`) 13.6-13.9 ms against 17.2-17.3 ms (1.27 times), each eye traced at 1234 x 1370 against the centre's
  1556 x 1376: the second eye's path tracing and upscaling, less the warp and the work done once a frame.
- **GMod blocks `fps_max` from Lua** (`RunConsoleCommand: Command is blocked! (fps_max)`), so a test cannot cap the
  frame rate from the add-on's realm.


## GitHub issue 5: "Default texture pack is not ready: resource_sampling_unsupported" (2026-11-13, Claude)

The player's two screenshots (1920x1080 and 1440x1080, a pool-rooms map and a dev-textured map, the stock HL2 HUD,
path tracing clearly on) show one white line at the exact centre of the screen in `DermaDefaultBold`:
`Default texture pack is not ready: resource_sampling_unsupported:[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`.
Fixed in the render guard ([ADR 0210](decisions/0210-an-add-ons-notice-of-the-guards-refusal-stays-off-the-screen.md),
[report](handover/issue5-report.md)). Screenshots and the MineMod files read are in the worktree's `out\issue5\`.

- **Not the package's text.** No branch of this repository, no other worktree, the fixes fork
  (`E:\Modding_Backup\garrys-mod-rtx-remixed`), the runtime fork (`out/worktrees/r17/out/runtime-src`), the content
  pack staging folders, the unpacked package parts (`out\inputs`, binary-safe), the published `.gma` of 2026-11-13 and
  the 838 Workshop items on this computer hold either string. GitHub code search finds both in
  [schweiziske/MineMod](https://github.com/schweiziske/MineMod) (MIT; "MineMod Engine", Minecraft's block worlds in
  GMod; last push 2026-11-10): `addons/mc_engine/data_static/mc/i18n/texture_pack/mc_engine.en_us.json`
  (`"loading.default_unavailable": "Default texture pack is not ready: {error}"`) and
  `addons/mc_engine/lua/mc/resources/cl_sampling.lua` (`reason="resource_sampling_unsupported:"..util.TableToJSON(samples)`).
  Note for later searches: Git Bash on this machine has no `rg`; a `rg ... 2>/dev/null | head` there fails silently.
- **MineMod's probe** (`MC.ResourceSampling.Get`, run by `MC.ResourceGeneration.Build` when the atlas has mip levels):
  six `screenspace_general_8tex` materials `mc_resource_sampling_<pixel shader>_<lod>` with the shader pack's
  `sampling` program as `$vertexshader`/`$pixshader` and `$c0_x` = lod 0-5; a 64x64 atlas texture with five mip levels
  of grey 16, 56, 96, 136, 176 (the Lua backend writes it as a VTF under `data/mc/resourcepacks/runtime/` and loads it
  through an `UnlitGeneric` proxy material, `../data/...`); a 16x16 RGBA8888 target `mc_resource_sampling` (size mode
  literal, depth none, flags 1|4|8|256|512). For each lod: `render.Clear(0,0,0,255)`, `render.SetMaterial`, a
  full-screen quad mesh under `render.OverrideBlend(true, BLEND_ONE, BLEND_ZERO, ...)`, `render.CapturePixels()`,
  `render.ReadPixel(8,8)`. It accepts an offset of 0 or 1 mip per channel (it names "Source's AMD GET1 sampler state"),
  else fails with the samples as JSON. Six read-backs, within R28's allowance of eight.
- **Why the samples are black under RTX.** The guard's `CreateMaterial` marks a `screenspace_general*` material with
  `$pixshader`/`$vertexshader` as incompatible (ADR 0086), and `render.SetMaterial` from
  `lua/mc/resources/cl_sampling.lua` binds the guard's transparent `UnlitGeneric` (`$alpha 0`) instead: all six
  samples are the clear colour `[0,0,0]`, as the screenshots show, so nothing of the quad reached the target (not
  measured in a game here; the probe's own values say so). The guard's own console line is
  `[nativeloader] RTX guard: render.SetMaterial: unsupported RTX shader draw (lua/mc/resources/cl_sampling.lua:<line>)`.
- **Why it stays on every map.** `R.RestorePreference()` (MineMod's `PostRender`) starts the default pack's bake once
  per catalog revision (`R.defaultAttempt`); the failed job keeps `MC.TexturePackPending` set, and MineMod's `HUDPaint`
  hook `mc_resource_pack_loading` (`lua/mc/cl_resource_packs.lua`) draws the line at `ScrW()/2, ScrH()/2` whenever the
  default pack is pending and the last job (`R.jobs[R.lastId]`) failed or was cancelled. MineMod reports the fault
  once in the console (`[MC fault] resource_default_bake: ...`, `sh_fault.lua`, `mc_strict 0`). While the pack is
  pending its render runtime draws no world (`cl_render_pack_runtime.lua`: `if MC.TexturePackPending then return`).
- **MineMod draws everything with its own shaders.** Its passes are `screenspace_general_8tex` materials with a shader
  pack's programs (`cl_render_pack_processing.lua`), and its block materials bind a shader pack program too
  (`cl_render_pack_resources.lua`, `P.Material` → `R.BoundMaterial(..., node.program, ...)`), so under RTX the guard
  keeps all of it inert: MineMod does not work in RTX sessions whatever its texture pack does. Its optional native
  module (`gmcl_minemod_native_win64.dll`) only builds meshes and uploads resources; Workshop clients use the Lua
  backend.
- **The owner's first guess** (another HUD or crosshair add-on) was reasonable for a centred line over the HUD; the
  player's "HL2 customizable hud" was not involved.
