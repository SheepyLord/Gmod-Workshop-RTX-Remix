# AGENTS.md

Start here. This file tells an agent (or a human) what this repo is, the rules that are not
negotiable, and how to build, test and document a change.

## What this repo is

A **native loader for vanilla 64-bit Garry's Mod**. The user drops one file, `bin\win64\winmm.dll`,
into an otherwise untouched Steam install. At start-up it reads **packages** (`.gma` files from the
Workshop or local folders), deploys their native payloads (the NVIDIA RTX Remix runtime, `gmcl_`
binary modules, files under the game root such as `rtx-remix\mods`) and loads the Remix runtime
before the engine creates its Direct3D 9 device. It replaces the old workflow of keeping a separate,
patched copy of GMod managed by RTXLauncher.

- What each component does: [docs/COMPONENTS.md](docs/COMPONENTS.md)
- Where we are and what is next: [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) (current: **M0-M7, R1, R3, R4 (reviews, fixes, the QoL round's review and field QA; loader 0.10.1), R5 (the user's QoL report), R6 (performance tiers and stability evidence; loader 0.11.0), C-16 (steady anime eye whites), G1 (a glass overhaul), R7 (the user's report of 2026-11-01; loader 0.12.0), R8 (the user's report after R7; loader 0.12.1), R9 (glass realism and feedback), R10 (the user's character report: steady eye whites for imported characters, NPCs after a map change, VMD expressions on the model's own morphs) and R11 (automatic PBR: imported game characters' own maps, kept when their source folder is gone; a safer ToPBR; real replacements always first), R12 (the user's report after R11-B: NPCs after a re-import, game maps for renamed textures and manual choices per texture, manual eye whites, unused character textures no longer held in VRAM) and R13 (less RAM and VRAM with budgets that scale with the computer: memory profiles in loader 0.13.0, characters loaded on first use, idle game textures released, compact imported game maps; the lag report's Combine trigger) done, R14 (noclip and glass; the guide with annotated screenshots) done, R15 (imported characters: painted shadows left out and solid hair in RTX sessions; the loader release candidate) done, R16 (the sky at a map's start; the RTX package built on GitHub with every native binary and a SHA-256 report) done, R17 (cloud genera for each weather, a sun disc and a high cloud layer in Numos; the package workflow started by hand for releases) done, R18 (R17's sky limits: thin decks that close, a middle deck with its own patches, sun dogs and the other ice halos, a milky haze, a longer twilight) done, R19 (the pre-release review's findings fixed: content packages only from subscriptions, bounded DDS readers, the fixes' Lua paths kept in the game; release v0.14.0, loader 0.14.0) done, R20 (the user's report of 2026-11-06: particle and decal add-ons under RTX, the upscaling hint from the runtime's live state, the loader update reminder and the warning before the server browser, Dynamic Toolgun Screen and Blood Overhaul RTX in the package with realistic blood impacts, time passing by default, the dupe icon; loader 0.15.0) done, R21 (Blood Overhaul's resources and their PBR in the package by the author's permission; no Model Hotloader warning about the game's build) done, R22 (a loading window while the first start unpacks the package, loader 0.16.0; the frame generation hint also at the top right) done, R23 (the user's report of 2026-11-08: an engine guard and start-up watchdog for "Starting Lua" hangs, ARC9 under RTX; Wuthering Waves game roughness and metalness; a PBR progress notice; the material editor's tabs; skills; the multiplayer notice on a loader branch awaiting approval) done, R24 (the multiplayer notice as Lua in the add-on, run in the menu realm; ARC9 view models' stickers and gun screens, its DirectX warning; view model materials through the pipeline; a load overlay saying what a map load is doing) done, R25 (the user's report of 2026-11-09: a stuck spawn-menu drag ended; ARC9's magnified scopes path traced through a raytraced render target, its gun path traced, no black copy of the scope) done, R26 (the user's request of 2026-11-09: the sky without a horizon; the load accelerator, failed file lookups and add-on searches answered from memory in RTX starts) done, R27 (the user's report of 2026-11-09: HUD add-ons that turned the screen white under RTX; depth-only colour targets and refused base textures in the render guard) done, R28 (the user's request of 2026-11-10: GitHub issue 2 resolved in the package: no Windows Error Reporting snapshot of a crashed game, no texture preload at the end of a load; periodic screen read-backs stopped and repeated font definitions made once under RTX, slow hooks named and `nativeloader_lag_report`; the light updater's bounded draw list) done; R2 (field parity with the classic install) in progress**)

## Repo map

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `loader/` | C++20 loader: `core/` library (`nl_core`), `tests/`, `proxy/` (the `winmm.dll`), `cli/` (`nlctl.exe`) |
| `tools/` | Build, test and maintenance scripts; each has a `.md` beside it |
| `tools/steam/` | Steam depot manifest tools: verify an install, build the vanilla PoC copy |
| `tools/gmapack/` | Vendored `.gma` reader and writer (Python) |
| `tools/sky/` | Tools that make the runtime's sky textures (the Moon, the night sky image) |
| `tools/ci/` | What `package.yml` builds the package's native binaries from (`pins.json`) and the scripts it runs: the fixes' modules, the debug module and the bridge, the runtime's files, this repository's modules, the Model Hotloader's natives, the pinned downloads, the cache keys ([tools/ci/README.md](tools/ci/README.md)); and the record of what this repository's own modules in `packages/` were built from, which `check_repo.py` checks: refresh them with `repo_builds.py refresh`, not `inputs.py import` ([ADR 0126](docs/decisions/0126-a-record-of-what-this-repositorys-modules-were-built-from.md)) |
| `packages/` | Every input of the RTX package's fourteen parts, so this repo alone builds it: text as it is, binaries xz-compressed in Git LFS, each part indexed in `files.json` ([packages/README.md](packages/README.md), [ADR 0033](docs/decisions/0033-one-repository-package-inputs-in-git-lfs.md)) |
| `runtime/` | This project's changes to the Remix runtime fork, as patches against the fork commit in `base.json`, with what else the build has (submodule settings, clones; [ADR 0034](docs/decisions/0034-the-runtimes-build-inputs-recorded.md)), and the script that rebuilds `d3d9.dll` from them ([runtime/README.md](runtime/README.md)) |
| `third_party/` | Vendored third-party code, byte-identical to upstream, each with its licence: `lzma/` (LZMA SDK decoder); `jolt/` (Jolt Physics 5.3.0, linked into the glass module); `reshade/` holds only ReShade's licence, for the unchanged ReShade binary the RTX package carries |
| `skills/` | Agent skills, each a `SKILL.md` with references and scripts: AI PBR materials for MMD characters (`mmd-remix-pbr`, with the `rpai` tool) and for maps (`remix-map-pbr`), and Workshop content packs with their dependencies (`workshop-content-pack`) ([skills/README.md](skills/README.md)) |
| `dist/` | What the end-user bundle ships besides `winmm.dll`: the default `native-loader/config.json` and the player README ([ADR 0017](docs/decisions/0017-release-bundle-and-ci.md)) |
| `glass/` | The glass system (G1, [ADR 0070](docs/decisions/0070-glass-overhaul.md)): `addon/` (the Lua add-on: panes, damage, cracks, fracture, broken-glass manager), `native/` (the Jolt client module for broken glass) |
| `engine_guard/` | The engine guard (R23, [ADR 0130](docs/decisions/0130-an-engine-guard-for-lua-start-up.md)): `gmcl_`/`gmsv_nlengineguard_win64.dll`, shipped in the fixes part: cuts material fallbacks that lead back into their own chain (they stopped RTX starts at "Starting Lua") and watches start-up to name a stuck add-on; from R24 also loaded in the menu realm, where its load overlay shows what a map load is doing ([ADR 0134](docs/decisions/0134-what-a-map-load-is-doing.md)); from R28 every realm's load also switches Windows Error Reporting's snapshot of the game off ([ADR 0142](docs/decisions/0142-no-crash-snapshot-of-the-game.md)) |
| `fs_accel/` | The load accelerator (R26, [ADR 0140](docs/decisions/0140-the-load-accelerator.md)): `gmcl_`/`gmsv_nlfsaccel_win64.dll` and its add-on (`addon/`, deployed as `garrysmod/addons/nlloadaccel`), the package's `load-accelerator` part: answers GMod's failed lookups in the loose add-on folders from directory listings (import hooks on `filesystem_stdio.dll`) and `file.Find(pattern, <add-on title>)` from an index of GMod's add-on table; loaded at menu start by the companion's `load_accel.lua`, in RTX starts (the loader hides the package's add-ons without RTX) |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI: `build.yml` runs `tools\test.ps1 -Config Release` and keeps the bundle as an artifact only for a `v*` tag, which releases it, or when a person starts it; no push of a branch or pull request starts it, and agents start it only for a release being prepared or when the user asks ([ADR 0114](docs/decisions/0114-the-loader-workflow-runs-only-for-a-release-or-by-hand.md)). `package.yml`, started only by a person for a release, builds the RTX package on GitHub, every native binary built or fetched there, reports the SHA-256 of the `.gma` and of every file in it, and keeps the newest `.gma` as its one `rtx-package` artifact ([ADR 0106](docs/decisions/0106-the-rtx-package-built-on-github.md), [ADR 0108](docs/decisions/0108-releases-built-on-github-by-hand-development-built-here.md)). Every artifact, the loader's bundle included, expires two days after its run ([ADR 0113](docs/decisions/0113-every-actions-artifact-expires-after-two-days.md)) |
| `docs/` | Architecture, package format, on-disk layout, testing, roadmap, research, decisions |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Notable changes, newest first |

## Rules

1. **Develop against the PoC install.** `H:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod_PoC` is a
   byte-exact vanilla copy made for experiments. The field install `...\common\GarrysMod` is the
   user's real game: change it only when the user asks in this conversation, after backing up what
   you will touch. The user replaced `GarrysMod_RTX_c` with this project's implementation on
   2026-10-30: it is no longer a classic RTX baseline. Never write there or in
   `GarrysMod_RTX_c_backups`; prepare a fresh legacy fixture under `out` for migration tests.
2. **Never write Steam's files on disk.** Depot files in any install stay byte-identical; anything we
   need differently happens in memory or through a declared, journaled override (later milestones).
   [`tools/steam/verify_install.py`](tools/steam/verify_install.py.md) proves an install is still vanilla.
   The user's legacy-migration request (2026-10-30) permits one narrow exception: restore recognized
   pre-existing RTXLauncher modifications to hash-verified stock bytes, with the old bytes archived
   first in the deployment transaction ([ADR 0042](docs/decisions/0042-legacy-remix-migration.md)).
   This never permits patching an otherwise vanilla depot file on disk.
3. **Never touch Remix `user.conf`**, and never destroy a file the user edited (compare hashes first).
   A package's `replace-owned` file that changed is put back, and whatever was in its place is kept
   (`native-loader\backup\edits`, or `backup\originals`, put back when the package goes); a
   `create-only` file the user changed stays theirs ([ADR 0035](docs/decisions/0035-restore-automatically.md),
   the user, 2026-10-29).
4. **Native code is opt-in.** Only allowlisted packages may deploy or load native code
   ([ADR 0003](docs/decisions/0003-native-trust-allowlist.md)); a package from any other subscribed
   Workshop item may hold content only ([ADR 0027](docs/decisions/0027-content-packages-from-any-subscription.md));
   subscribed means Steam's record names a subscriber, not merely installed: any server can make the game
   download an item ([ADR 0111](docs/decisions/0111-content-packages-only-from-subscribed-items.md)). Do not loosen the allowlist, the path
   rules or the off switches without a new decision record that the user agreed to.
5. **Ask before anything outward-facing:** pushing to `origin`, publishing or updating a Workshop
   item, changing Steam settings or launch options, deleting user data.
   - **Standing permission** (the user, 2026-10-28;
     [ADR 0019](docs/decisions/0019-agents-push-main-and-update-workshop.md)): agents push `main` to
     `origin` and update the project's Workshop items (3829070317 and test items) without asking, once
     `tools\test.ps1` passes. Other branches, tags (a `v*` tag makes a public release) and force pushes
     still need asking.
   - **Test items** (the user, 2026-10-28): agents may upload test items for this project to the
     Workshop, and update them, without asking. Keep them hidden. Modern House RTX is one: 3829275998
     ([ADR 0023](docs/decisions/0023-content-packages-and-modern-house-item.md)).
   - **Never remove or delete anything on the Workshop until the user says the project is done.** That
     covers the test items too (the first is 3829070317,
     [ADR 0015](docs/decisions/0015-workshop-route-for-native-packages.md)).
   - Making an item public, or publishing another real package, still needs the user's go-ahead.
   - **Item 3829070317 is the project's distribution item** (the user, 2026-10-28;
     [ADR 0016](docs/decisions/0016-one-workshop-item-kept-current.md)). It holds the combined RTX
     package, and during development commits, merges and pushes of `main` keep it current: git hooks
     run [`tools/publish_workshop.py`](tools/publish_workshop.py.md) in the background, which builds the
     package here from `packages/` and uploads it when its content changed. That update needs no asking.
     A commit on `main` therefore publishes whatever its packaging inputs hold, so test those changes on
     a branch first. **Only a person starts GitHub's package workflow** (`package.yml`, every native
     binary built there and a SHA-256 report), for a release; `publish_workshop.py --from-ci` then
     uploads that run's `.gma` ([ADR 0106](docs/decisions/0106-the-rtx-package-built-on-github.md),
     [ADR 0108](docs/decisions/0108-releases-built-on-github-by-hand-development-built-here.md)), within
     two days, before the run's artifacts expire
     ([ADR 0113](docs/decisions/0113-every-actions-artifact-expires-after-two-days.md)). Never
     start that workflow yourself. The build checks the package with the **main checkout's** built
     `nlctl.exe`: after a manifest change (a new key or kind), run `tools\build.ps1 -Config Release`
     there before the merge, or the publish fails. Install the hooks once per clone:
     `python tools\publish_workshop.py --install-hooks` (they also run Git LFS's hooks; a push without
     git-lfs is refused). The package's content comes from `packages/` and its native binaries from
     the sources `runtime/`, `tools/ci/pins.json` and this repository name, so a part changes only by a
     change committed here; the add-ons' own repositories do not reach the item.
6. **No binaries in git, except the RTX package's inputs in `packages/`** (the user, 2026-10-30;
   [ADR 0033](docs/decisions/0033-one-repository-package-inputs-in-git-lfs.md)): there every binary is
   stored xz-compressed in Git LFS, and only through `tools\inputs.py import`, which indexes it. No game
   files, build outputs or `.gma` packages anywhere else. Test fixtures are generated by the tests. Mind
   the LFS quota (10 GiB of storage and of downloads a month; a pushed object is never freed): import
   only what a part ships.
7. **Licences.** This repo is MIT. `garrys-mod-rtx-remixed` is GPL-2.0: read it for behaviour, do not
   copy its code into this repo's code. Its shipped files and local interface changes remain in
   `packages/fixes` under that licence, a separate part the package aggregates. The translated
   interface data in `companion/i18n/addons` is also GPL-2.0; the package carries its editable catalogs
   and `COPYING` ([ADR 0038](docs/decisions/0038-complete-bundled-interface-translations.md)).
   Third-party code goes in `third_party/<name>/` with its licence file; a part in `packages/` keeps
   its source's licence beside it. The repository is public (the user made it so by 2026-11-06, as
   https://github.com/SheepyLord/Gmod-Workshop-RTX-Remix): everything in `packages/` is published
   with it, so a part holds only what may be redistributed.

8. **Parallel milestones stay apart.** Each runs on its own branch in its own git worktree, and only
   touches the paths its brief in [docs/handover/](docs/handover/README.md) assigns. Shared docs
   (CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, COMPONENTS, RESEARCH, TESTING) get additive edits only, so merges stay trivial.
9. **Temporary and build files stay inside this repo, under the git-ignored `out\`** (the user's
   instruction): builds in `out\build\<preset>`, extra git worktrees in `out\worktrees\<name>`, test
   scratch in `out\tmp` (`tools\test.ps1` and `tools\build.ps1` point `TEMP`/`TMP` there), evidence in
   `out\<purpose>\`. Never the system temp folder or a sibling folder: in M1, Windows Defender blocked
   proxy builds and test hosts that were outside this folder.

## Build and test

```powershell
tools\test.ps1                  # everything: conventions, Python tests, C++ build + CTest
tools\test.ps1 -SkipNative      # no compiler needed
tools\build.ps1 -Config Release # optimised C++ build (PDBs included)
tools\workflow.ps1              # what CI runs: Release checks, then the end-user bundle in out\dist
tools\workflow.ps1 -SkipTests -Install <game root>   # quick loop: build, bundle, put it in a game
git lfs pull; tools\workflow.ps1 -Package             # also the RTX package from packages\ (a local build: compared, not uploaded)
python tools\build_package.py --compare out\workshop\published.json   # the package alone, against the item
```

Toolchain: VS 2022 Build Tools (MSVC x64), CMake and Ninja bundled with it, Python 3.10+. `vswhere`
cannot see the Build Tools on the main machine; `tools\lib\VsDevEnv.psm1` handles that. Build output
goes to `out\` (git-ignored).

## Documentation duties (every change)

`tools\test.ps1` fails until these hold (checked by [`tools/check_repo.py`](tools/check_repo.py.md)):

- Every script (`.ps1 .psm1 .py .bat .cmd .lua .sh`) has `<script file name>.md` beside it: what it
  does, usage, inputs/outputs, side effects, exit codes. Update it when the script changes.
- Every C++ module folder (one with a `CMakeLists.txt`) has a `README.md` naming each source file.
- [docs/COMPONENTS.md](docs/COMPONENTS.md) lists every folder under `loader/` and `tools/`.
- Relative Markdown links resolve.

Not machine-checked, still required:

- Add a line under `## [Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for every user-visible or
  design-relevant change (new component, changed behaviour, fixed bug, new rule).
- Record design decisions as a new file in [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/README.md); never rewrite an
  accepted decision, supersede it.
- Update [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) when a milestone item starts or finishes.
- Add facts you had to dig for (file:line, measured numbers) to [docs/RESEARCH.md](docs/RESEARCH.md).
