# cl_rtx.lua

GPL-2.0 RTX fixes client entry point. Requires RTXFixesBinary and NikNaks, loads the shared/client
rendering scripts, restores rendering cvars and registers model-reload and shutdown cleanup hooks.
It runs through the engine in ordinary sessions, or through the verified RTX catalog in multiplayer.
No standalone command-line interface; failures are reported locally.

The verified late multiplayer initializer sets NATIVELOADER_VERIFIED_MULTIPLAYER only in its
scoped script environment. In that context the initial/final model hardware-cache flushes are
skipped: the world already holds static-prop mesh references. Existing meshes stay valid and
the native VTX hooks serve subsequent loads. Ordinary early engine loading keeps both reloads.

Loaded normally (outside that environment, once the binary module is installed), it sets the
global NATIVELOADER_RTX_NORMAL_LOAD. The verified initializer then finishes without running the
payload a second time: on a listen host, an sv_allowcslua 1 server or a server that ships these
add-ons, the normal load already ran it.

The final flush (one second after InitPostEntity) runs while the world is drawn. With queued
rendering (mat_queue_mode 2, what gmod_mcore_test 1 picks) it raced the material system's thread
drawing the meshes it discards: about half of the native loader's PoC starts crashed in studiorender
(review R4, 2026-10-31). It now switches queued rendering off, flushes four frames later (leaving
that mode, the material system waits for its thread), and puts the player's mat_queue_mode back; if
the switch does not take, it skips the flush and says so.

Native loader (ADR 0206): this file and the add-on's other autoruns (sh_rtx.lua, sv_rtx.lua, tmc.lua,
matdebug.lua) first return unless the companion's first autorun says this machine's loader activated RTX
(NativeLoaderRTXStart) or the verified multiplayer initializer runs them. A start through an off switch, a game
whose loader was removed, or files a loader left behind therefore run none of the fixes without the runtime.
