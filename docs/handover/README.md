# Handovers

The latest round is R28, the user's request of 2026-11-10 (GitHub issue 2 resolved in the package: no Windows Error
Reporting snapshot of a crashed game, no texture preload at the end of a load; add-ons like HyperReal FX kept from
lagging the game: periodic screen read-backs stopped, repeated font definitions made once, slow hooks named and
`nativeloader_lag_report`; the light updater's bounded draw list): [R28-report.md](R28-report.md), done by Claude with a
Claude subagent for the review (no Codex).

Before it, R27, the user's report of 2026-11-09 (HUD add-ons that turned the screen white under RTX:
HUD Mk.2's "depth-only" colour target and the render guard's refused bindings): [R27-report.md](R27-report.md),
done by Claude with a Claude subagent for the review (no Codex).

Before it, R26, the user's request of 2026-11-09 (the sky without a horizon, for universe and
floating-island maps; faster map loads with hundreds of add-ons, the load accelerator, in RTX starts):
[R26-report.md](R26-report.md), done by Claude with Claude subagents for the sky option and the review (no
Codex).

Beside it, a diagnosis of GitHub issue #2 (lag, high RAM use, a game that lingers after a crash) with a player's 654
Workshop add-ons: [issue-2-memory-report.md](issue-2-memory-report.md), by Claude; R28 made its fixes 1 to 4 and 7,
and says what is left of 5 and 6.

Before it, R25, the user's report of 2026-11-09 (a spawn-menu icon left on the screen by a drag GMod
never ended; ARC9's magnified scopes path traced through a raytraced render target; ARC9's gun path traced, its
screen reads and 2D before the view model skipped): [R25-report.md](R25-report.md), done by Claude with Claude
subagents for two reviews (no Codex).

Before it, R24, the user's follow-up of 2026-11-08 (the multiplayer notice as Lua in the add-on;
ARC9 view models' stickers, gun screens and DirectX warning; view model materials through the pipeline; what a
map load is doing, in an overlay; load time measured): [R24-report.md](R24-report.md), done by Claude with one
Claude subagent for the review (no Codex).

Before it, R23, the user's report of 2026-11-08 (an engine guard and start-up watchdog for
"Starting Lua" hangs, ARC9 under RTX; Wuthering Waves game maps; a PBR progress notice; the material
editor's tabs; the skills; the multiplayer notice on a loader branch awaiting approval):
[R23-report.md](R23-report.md), done by Claude with one Claude subagent (no Codex).

Before it, R22, the user's item 52 (a loading window while the first start unpacks the
package, loader 0.16.0; the frame generation hint also at the top right): [R22-report.md](R22-report.md),
done by Claude alone at the user's request (no Codex).

Before it, R21, the user's two requests after R20's release (Blood Overhaul's resources by
permission; no Hotloader warning after game updates): [R21-report.md](R21-report.md), with its
[plan](R21-plan.md) and the task reports ([A](R21-A-report.md), [B](R21-B-report.md)), then the 4K GPU
timeout during a map load, closed as not reproducible ([R21-C](R21-C-report.md)).

Before it, R20, the user's report of 2026-11-06 (items 44-51), loader 0.15.0:
[R20-report.md](R20-report.md), with its [plan](R20-plan.md) and the task reports
([A](R20-A-report.md), [B](R20-B-report.md), [C](R20-C-report.md), [D](R20-D-report.md),
[E](R20-E-report.md), [Q](R20-Q-report.md)), then the field check of the published package
([R20-F](R20-F-report.md)) and the fix it led to, the toolgun display at night ([R20-T](R20-T-report.md)).

R20-T diagnoses the night field finding and fixes the toolgun's HUD material depth state:
[brief](R20-T-toolgun-night.md), [report](R20-T-report.md), branch `r20-toolgun`. The report keeps
the 4K before/after views, older-runtime comparison, native RTX-off cases and preservation receipts.

Before it, R19: the pre-release review's findings fixed and release v0.14.0: [R19-report.md](R19-report.md), with its [plan](R19-plan.md) and the [verified review](R19-review.md); before it R18, R17's sky limits addressed (thin decks that close, a middle deck with its own patches, sun dogs and the other ice halos, a milky haze, a longer twilight): [R18-report.md](R18-report.md); before it R17, a sky that fits the weather (cloud genera for each weather, a sun disc, a high cloud layer) and the package workflow started by hand: [R17-report.md](R17-report.md); before it R16, the sky at a map's start and the RTX package built on GitHub with every native binary and a hash report: [R16-report.md](R16-report.md); and R15, imported characters' painted shadows and solid hair, then the loader's release candidate: [R15-report.md](R15-report.md).

The latest QoL batch fixes [player bodies, arms and shadows](../decisions/0043-player-body-viewmodel-and-shadows.md).
The previous batch adds legacy Remix migration in loader 0.8.0. GarrysMod_RTX_c now runs our implementation and is no longer the classic baseline.

When a milestone moves to another agent (or person), the giver writes a **brief** here and the
receiver writes a **report** here when done or blocked. Both are committed on the milestone branch,
so the next agent has the full story without the chat transcripts.

R20-B handover: [R20-B-report.md](R20-B-report.md), including the sky migration, startup hint consumer,
and the native live-readback requirement that remains open.

G1-B implementation/offline validation is complete: [G1-B report](G1-B-report.md). G1-A and Claude's
integration/game acceptance remain separate from that native/debris report.

G1-B's post-game fix pass is complete for implementation/offline checks:
[G1-B fix report](G1-B-fix-report.md), branch `g1-native-fix`. Integration/game acceptance remains
with Claude; the report includes real-map import counts and before/after timing limits.

## Rules for briefs

- Self-contained for someone who has read [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and nothing else.
- State scope, files the assignee may and may not touch, acceptance criteria, how to test, what to
  report, and when to stop and ask.
- Never rewrite an accepted decision record in a brief; point to it, or ask for a new one.

## Rules for reports

- What was built (files), decisions taken (with any new decision record), test evidence (commands
  and the lines that show success), deviations from the brief, open issues, questions for the user.
- Facts worth keeping also go into [docs/RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md); the report links to them.

## Native package addon menu

The 2026-10-30 continuation of QoL adds loader 0.7.0's native-package warning suppression, blue cards
and Workshop descriptions. See [QoL-report.md](QoL-report.md#native-package-addon-cards-2026-10-30)
and [ADR 0039](../decisions/0039-native-package-addon-presentation.md). Source branch:
`codex/native-addon-menu`, worktree `out/worktrees/native-addon-menu`.

## Native map glass

The next QoL batch fixes Modern House glass disappearing without shards. Source branch:
`codex/map-glass`, worktree `out/worktrees/map-glass`. See
[QoL-report.md](QoL-report.md#modern-house-map-glass-2026-10-30) and
[ADR 0040](../decisions/0040-native-map-glass-debris.md).

## Hotloader DepthWrite errors

The QoL shader batch is on codex/hotloader-depth in out/worktrees/hotloader-depth. See
[QoL-report.md](QoL-report.md#hotloader-depthwrite-shader-errors-2026-10-30) and
