# nativeloader_upscaling_hint.lua

Client-only R20-B startup advice ([ADR 0117](../../../../../docs/decisions/0117-startup-upscaling-hint-and-sky-defaults.md)).
The companion loads this automatically in its RTX-only add-on. No command or manual invocation.

`nativeloader_upscaling_hint` is archived, default `1`; its translated checkbox follows Frame
generation in RTX Remix > Remix settings, and turns off the hint and its notice. `cl_showhints 0`
suppresses the sandbox hint only (R22): the top-right notice still shows. The first map's
first `PostRender` starts a 12-second minimum delay. The first-run guide, spawn/pause menus and
Remix's own menu defer the decision until the map is unobstructed; the current snapshot is read
after closing them, never queued from before an edit. An unavailable live readout is retried every
two seconds, at most 25 attempts (60 seconds when unobstructed). UI waiting spends no readiness
attempt and does no DATA/snapshot reads. Nothing runs in a render callback
except scheduling the timer. No snapshot, invalid state or unsupported hardware means silence.

R22 ([ADR 0129](../../../../../docs/decisions/0129-the-upscaling-hint-also-at-the-top-right.md)): when the
hint shows, the same text also shows in a notice at the top right, like the Model Hotloader's: the
title RTX Remix, the hint's text and a close button, 20 px from the right and 40 px from the top,
below a notice-sized panel already in that corner. It fades in, stays 15 seconds and fades out; its
size and fonts scale with `ScrH()/1080` (at least 0.65). It follows the hint's decision and the RTX
tab's checkbox, but not `cl_showhints` (it is not a sandbox hint; the user's own game had hints off).
A notice that cannot be made never costs the hint.

R23: the notice is [`nativeloader/notice.lua`](../../nativeloader/notice.lua.md), shared with the
start-up stall notice and the imported characters' PBR progress; the hint's notice is unchanged.

The schema-1 loader status must report active RTX, a selected performance-tier adapter, NVIDIA's
vendor id (`4318`) and `non_nvidia = false`. Only recognized RTX 20/30/40/50 model names qualify.
DLSS-G is suggested only for an RTX 40/50 with a positive live capability flag. RTX 20/30 can receive
FSR 3 advice when its live capability flag is true. A file-only getter is never consulted.

## Live snapshot contract

The native `RemixConfig.GetUpscalingState()` returns a fresh, atomic table. Since R20-E the fixes'
module provides it (sixth GPL patch, `packages/fixes/licenses/oversized-skinning/upscaling-state`),
reading the snapshot runtime patch 0040 publishes as `rtx.runtime.upscalingState`
([ADR 0123](../../../../../docs/decisions/0123-live-upscaling-readback.md)); with an older runtime
it returns `nil` and the hint stays silent:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ready` | Boolean true only after startup graphics/DLSS presets and pending option callbacks resolve |
| `upscaler` | Effective `rtx.upscalerType`, integer 0 through 5 |
| `frame_generation` | Effective `rtx.frameGenerationType`, integer 0 through 2 |
| `dlss_supported` | Boolean true only when DLSS is usable on the selected device |
| `dlss_frame_generation_supported` | Boolean true only when DLSS-G is usable |
| `fsr_frame_generation_supported` | Boolean true only when FSR 3 frame generation is usable |

`nil`, a raised error, `ready ~= true`, unknown enum values and absent capability flags never
produce advice about the corresponding feature. `GetConfigVariable` is never used for this: it reads
only `rtx.conf`, and the runtime's startup log precedes device-dependent graphics presets.

In this runtime `rtx.frameGenerationType` is the control that enables frame generation: its change
handler drives `rtx.dlfg.enable` / `rtx.fsrfg.enable` (`rtx_options.h`, `FrameGenerationType` and
`fork_hooks::applyFrameGenerationType`), so the published selector is the effective state.

## Lifetime and side effects

The marker `garrysmod/data/nativeloader_companion/upscaling_hint_start.txt` contains the loader's
process id and startup UTC. It consumes a successful decision (including both features on), an
opt-out/unsupported GPU, or an exhausted readout retry. It prevents a second hint when the Lua
realm restarts for another map; a new process startup UTC permits another. Failed marker writes
suppress the hint, and DATA/JSON/native read errors never interrupt the game.

One `notification.AddLegacy(..., NOTIFY_HINT, 18)` with three short lines and sandbox's water-drip
hint sound is emitted. Wording distinguishes upscaling off, frame generation off and both, with
DLSS-G/FSR 3 advice chosen by capabilities. All five messages and the checkbox are in all six catalogs.
The file writes no Remix option, `user.conf` or other settings file. No exit code; runs as game Lua.

Tests: [QoL harness](../../../../../tools/tests/companion_qol_harness.lua.md) and
[runner](../../../../../tools/tests/test_companion_qol.py.md).

Integration QA must retain an obstructing frame while live edits/presets converge, then allow
the full delay/poll interval after closing it. Keep ordinary sky/effect writers active: R20-E's
corrected patch 0040 invalidates only the 19 relevant option dependencies. R20-Q's combined-runtime
follow-up reads ready 3,140 times with no pending/wrong steady samples while the sky keeps writing.
The original unrelated-write defect and its corrected acceptance are in the integration report;
never trust an unready snapshot.
