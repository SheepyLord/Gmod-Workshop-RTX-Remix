# loader/client/tests

`test_module.cpp` checks the `poll.h` throttle and attempt bound, and reads `module.cpp` (its path is
a compile definition) for the contracts a unit test cannot reach without a game: no field access
on the client realm, the temporary API raw-set inside the protected initializing step, Poll only
pushing and protect-calling that step, and the self-pin before the Think hook hands out callbacks. R24: the menu
scripts' read API answers only in the menu realm and only for the companion's catalog entries, only direct
children of `nativeloader/menu/` run, the API is removed after them, and they run once after the pin, never from Poll;
and the module takes the menu's part only in the engine's own menu state (`GetLuaInterface(State::MENU)`), checked
before `menu` is set (the R24 review: `MENU_DLL` alone can be set by any realm's Lua).

`test_catalog.cpp` exercises the actual `catalog::prepare` policy in synthetic game folders under
the test build's scratch directory. `CMakeLists.txt` builds `nl_client_catalog_tests` with the
existing `loader/tests/test_main.cpp` / `nl_test.h` harness. No game, network, real install, or user
configuration is opened.

Cases cover exact RTX package/source ownership, local/dev-folder/Workshop allowlists, unrelated
files and add-ons, disabled policy, module binding, byte/size/NUL limits, missing files, case
collisions, junctions and immutable snapshots. Committed-journal parsing is checked separately for
unsafe paths, preserving the loader's existing path and protected-folder rules. Junction creation
uses a generated directory and is skipped if the platform refuses it; the target is never followed
during cleanup.

The secure-render policy cases use independent copies of the seven shipped recipe specifications,
not accepted digest values. They require the exact owner/module/name/find/offset/replace fields,
and reject altered ordering, additional patches and every proper subset. The separate config
suite checks the opt-out's boolean type and that it does not alter native allowlists or the general
insecure patch gate. The render-recipe refusal cases (ADR 0056) require activation to fall back
exactly when the opt-out leaves the reviewed recipes skipped: no `-insecure` on the command line
(case-insensitive, quoted values excluded) or in the plan's own arguments, and the general gate
closed. Other owners, changed recipes or no patch sets never refuse.

Build with `cmake --build --preset win64-release --target nl_client_catalog_tests`, then
`ctest --test-dir out/build/win64-release -R ^nl_client_catalog_tests$ --output-on-failure`.
