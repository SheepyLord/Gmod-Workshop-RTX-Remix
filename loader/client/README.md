# loader/client

Native client-payload support for this project's allowlisted RTX package. It does not change
sv_allowcslua, widen the native source allowlist, or create a general source-execution API.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `catalog.h`, `catalog.cpp` | Validate the enabled RTX owner/source, bind the bootstrap module to its journaled SHA-256, and snapshot only owned add-on Lua whose exact bytes match the committed generation |
| `module.cpp` | Menu-realm module entry, active-owned-runtime and committed-journal checks, the companion's menu scripts (R24), client-realm lifecycle polling, private catalog callbacks, completion/status and cleanup. From loader 0.10.1 every client-realm access is raw and runs inside one protected call on that realm, the temporary API is raw-set, and the module pins itself while its callbacks stay reachable ([ADR 0056](../../docs/decisions/0056-guard-and-startup-fallbacks.md)) |
| `poll.h` | The polling policy: a client-realm check at most every 250 ms, and at most 480 initializer runs (two minutes) for a realm whose local player never becomes valid |
| `bootstrap.lua` | Private client initializer: scoped include/require/file helpers, shared/client autoruns, client entity registration and owned initialization-hook replay |
| `bootstrap.lua.md` | Initializer behavior and side effects |
| `bootstrap_data.h.in` | CMake embedding template for the initializer |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | Static catalog library, native module, script embedding and test targets |
| `tests/` | Synthetic catalog policy, polling-policy and module source-contract checks; see [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) |

R24 ([ADR 0133](../../docs/decisions/0133-the-multiplayer-notice-in-the-companion.md)): once verified, the module runs
the companion's menu scripts, the catalog's `nativeloader/nativeloader/menu/*.lua` (direct children only, in name
order), once in the menu realm, where Workshop add-ons' Lua never runs. While they run,
`__NATIVELOADER_MENU_API.read(name)` returns a verified file of the companion add-on (`nativeloader/...` keys only)
and `identity` the manifest digest; the global is removed afterwards, and `read` answers only in the menu realm. The
multiplayer notice is one such script, so its text and behaviour change with the package, not the loader. The status
line ends with `menu scripts <n>` (how many ran without an error). The module takes the menu's part only in the
engine's own menu Lua state (`lua_shared`'s `GetLuaInterface(MENU)`): any realm's Lua can set `MENU_DLL`, and a
listen server's realm that passed for the menu would have taken over the catalog and ended it when it closed (the R24
review).

The module consumes the existing protected native-loader journal and config through nl_core.
Catalog preparation expects a validated committed generation; normal use refuses absent/pending
journals, disabled policy and an active renderer that is not the package's deployed runtime.
Only package gmod-rtx-remix is accepted. Local and development sources must match their own
allowlist entries; Workshop loading is limited to distribution item 3829070317.

R20-A exposes the same `allowed_runtime_source` check to the loader release-record reader, so menu
announcements cannot obtain a broader native source policy than the client bootstrap.

Catalog keys identify an add-on and virtual Lua path. Callback reads are exact map lookups into an
immutable verified snapshot, not arbitrary filesystem reads. Source is limited to 2 MiB per file
and 64 MiB total, with NUL text and case-colliding keys refused. Generic developer automation
rtx_agent and mmdhl/debug.lua is excluded from this multiplayer path. Other community files and
server code remain subject to the original engine APIs.

`secure_render_patch_set` recognizes only the exact SHA-256 fingerprints of the seven reviewed
rendering fixes emitted by tools/package_fixes.py and only for gmod-rtx-remix. Changing a recipe,
adding/removing a patch or using another owner cannot inherit the secure-render exception.
Other memory patches retain their general insecure gate, and config can disable this exception.

The Garry's Mod interface headers are vendored separately under third_party/gmod with their
BSD-3-Clause notice. Build with the normal tools/build.ps1 flow. Development/build/test scratch
belongs under the repository's out directory; no build step installs into a real game.
