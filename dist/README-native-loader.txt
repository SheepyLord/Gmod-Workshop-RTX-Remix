GMod native loader: RTX Remix for Garry's Mod (64-bit)
=======================================================

This zip holds the loader and its settings:

  bin\win64\winmm.dll          the loader
  native-loader\config.json    its settings: allows the RTX Remix Workshop item 3829070317

Install
-------

1. Close Garry's Mod.
2. Extract this zip into your Garry's Mod folder, the one that holds gmod.exe, for example
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod
   Windows may ask whether to merge the folders: say yes. If bin\win64 already holds a winmm.dll
   (another mod's loader), the zip replaces it: keep a copy first, to put back when you remove
   this loader.
3. Subscribe to the RTX Remix item on the Steam Workshop:
   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3829070317
4. In Steam, set Garry's Mod's beta branch to x86-64 (Properties > Betas), then start the game.
   - Loader 0.8.0 detects a supported previous RTXLauncher/Remix installation and backs up its
     replaced files under native-loader\backup\legacy before deploying our shipment. user.conf,
     personal mods and data stay intact. The backup stays after uninstall. Links in its folders
     (such as those of Mount HL2 RTX) are never followed or moved; they stay where they are.
   - Known old changes to Steam files are restored only from hash-verified vanilla copies, and only
     on the GMod build the loader knows. On another build, or next to a change it does not
     recognize, every Steam file stays as it is (the rest is still backed up) and the loader log
     says so: verify the game in Steam to undo those changes. If a vanilla copy is missing, the
     previous installation stays as it is, the package deploys anyway, and the log names the file.
     Steam verification (then the next start), or nlctl apply <game root> --legacy-source
     <verified vanilla root>, completes the migration.
   - The first start after a download, or after an update of the package, unpacks it: about 7 GB,
     which takes a minute or more (longer on a hard disk) before the game's window opens. Keep the
     game running. Loader 0.16.0 and later show a window with the progress until the game opens.
     This shipment needs this loader (0.10.0 or later); an older loader keeps the version it has.
   - The package also brings Model Hotloader (with its native files), Advanced Material Editor,
     Advanced Bodygroup Tool, Procedural Bodygroup Destruction and the Character Motion Importer for
     RTX sessions. If you put copies of them into garrysmod\addons or their files into
     garrysmod\lua\bin yourself, the loader (0.6.0 or later) moves the files in the package's way
     to native-loader\backup\originals and puts them back when the package is removed. An older
     loader stops at them: move them out first.
   - The package's files stay as the package has them: one you change is put back at the next
     start, and your copy is kept in native-loader\backup\edits.
   - With loader 0.7.0 or later, deployed native packages have blue cards in the Addons menu and show
     their Workshop descriptions. Their native-container mount warnings are suppressed. The loader
     still deploys their payloads; other addon errors remain visible.
   - Loader 0.9.0 initializes this allowlisted RTX bundle's verified client scripts when joining
     multiplayer servers, including servers with sv_allowcslua 0. The package no longer adds
     -insecure. Other local add-ons follow the server's normal rules; server-side tools still need
     the matching server add-on. RTXDebug supports client rendering diagnostics in multiplayer.
   - Loader 0.10.0 starts the verified rendering compatibility guard before third-party autoruns
     on supported game builds. RTX sessions use the stock Direct3D 9 backend even if your launch
     options select a different shader API. Your Steam options and graphics DLL files stay as they
     are; the alternate backend choice applies again when RTX is off. Guarded effects can use a
     limited fallback when their rendering path is unsupported. Coverage depends on the add-on
     and renderer; custom DX11 effects need a compatible implementation.
     The guard also runs in multiplayer through the verified RTX payload. That path starts after
     the client is ready, so earlier server scripts and their cached API references remain outside it.
   - Loader 0.10.1 keeps RTX on when a game update changes the files the early guard is built from:
     the guard then starts with the add-ons instead, and a note in native-loader\logs says why.
     A listen server you host no longer passes the guard to friends without RTX, and the RTX
     scripts no longer run twice on servers that already send them.
   - Loader 0.14.0 starts the guard only in a start that runs RTX. A start with -nonativeloader
     right after an RTX session used to get it from that session's old report.
   - Loader 0.15.0 shows a main-menu reminder when the Workshop package knows a newer loader
     release. Older loaders show it after a map loads. Close Garry's Mod, download winmm.dll
     from the release page, replace bin\win64\winmm.dll in the game folder, then restart.
     The Workshop package updates automatically; the loaded DLL needs this manual replacement.
     Later skips this start; Don't remind me remembers only that release, so a newer one asks again.
   - Before opening the multiplayer browser, RTX sessions warn that servers may forbid RTX Remix
     or ReShade and may kick or ban users. Check each server's rules. Online performance and
     stability are not guaranteed, especially without that map's PBR/RTX content. Use this add-on
     on servers at your own risk; its developers take no responsibility for any consequences.
     Continue opens the browser; Back returns home. Don't show this again is saved on Continue.
   - With RTX the game opens as a borderless window covering your main screen. Exclusive fullscreen
     crashes the RTX Remix runtime. For another size, add -w <width> -h <height> to the game's launch
     options in Steam; a -windowed or -fullscreen of yours there is used as it is.
   - In the game: the spawn menu's "RTX Remix" tab holds every RTX setting, and the console command
     nativeloader_guide opens a guide (it opens by itself the first time).

Graphics cards
--------------

- RTX Remix needs a GPU with hardware ray tracing: NVIDIA RTX 20 or newer, AMD Radeon RX 6000 or
  newer, Intel Arc. An older card cannot start an RTX session: turn RTX off with
  "remix": { "enabled": false } (Settings, below). The loader then keeps the package's RTX-only
  add-ons out of the game and puts back the console settings that RTX sessions changed.
- Loader 0.11.0 matches Remix's settings to your NVIDIA card (performance tiers). "high" keeps the
  package's settings, tuned on an RTX 5090. "medium" (for example an RTX 4070, or a card with 10 to
  12 GB) and "low" (an RTX 4060, 3060 or 2060, or any card with 8 GB) use fewer light bounces, a
  lighter neural radiance cache and smaller memory budgets, so the frame rate holds up and more
  video memory stays free. The loader takes the lower of what the card's memory and its model
  allow; a laptop GPU counts one step lower. The "RTX Remix" tab's Start here page shows the tier
  and why. Settings you save in Remix's menu (Alt+X) still win over the tier's.
- Frame generation is off at first. Turn it on in the "RTX Remix" tab (Remix settings > Frame
  generation): DLSS-G needs an RTX 40 or newer, and more than one generated frame (3x, 4x) an RTX 50,
  set in Remix's menu (Alt+X).
- On AMD and Intel: DLSS, DLSS frame generation and Reflex are NVIDIA-only. FSR (upscaling and frame
  generation) and XeSS are there instead; they have not been tried on a Radeon or Arc card yet.
  Without an NVIDIA GPU, Remix picks its graphics preset for your GPU at the start
  (native-loader\remix\non-nvidia.conf); a preset you choose in Remix's menu (Alt+X) and save there
  still wins. The first time each effect is used you may see a short stutter.
- The integrated Radeon graphics of a Ryzen processor could not run an RTX session in a test: the GPU
  was lost about a minute in. With a separate graphics card, Remix uses that card.

Memory and smaller computers
----------------------------

- The minimum is a graphics card with 8 GB of video memory (VRAM) and 16 GB of system memory
  (RAM). 16 GB and 32 GB are recommended. Smaller computers are not supported: the game may stutter
  or run out of memory.
- Loader 0.13.0 sizes what the game keeps in memory to your computer. It picks a memory profile from
  whichever is smaller, VRAM or RAM:
  - "minimum": 8 GB and 16 GB.
  - "recommended": 16 GB and 32 GB.
  - "high": 24 GB and 64 GB or more.
  The "RTX Remix" tab's Start here page shows the profile.
  - Characters you imported load when you first use them. On a minimum computer the first spawn of
    each one can take a moment. Recommended keeps your five most recently used characters ready,
    high ten. With an older loader none is kept ready, so every character loads on first use.
  - Game textures that nothing has drawn for a minute leave the graphics card once they take more
    than a quarter of its memory, and come back when they are used again. A minimum computer keeps
    one copy of each texture instead of two.
  - When the graphics card runs short, RTX Remix's own textures that nothing has drawn for a few
    seconds shrink until something draws them again.
- What takes the most memory:
  - Many imported characters in one session.
  - Hundreds of Workshop subscriptions: every map and model adds textures.
  - RTX Remix mods in rtx-remix\mods: most load all their textures at start, used or not. Remove
    the ones you no longer use, and keep each character's PBR in one mod only.
  - The resolution: 4K needs far more than 1920x1080.
- On an 8 GB card, play at 1920x1080 with the "low" performance tier (the loader picks it for you)
  and unsubscribe from Workshop add-ons you no longer use.

Settings (native-loader\config.json)
------------------------------------

- native-loader\remix holds copies of the package's Remix settings, written again at every RTX start
  (0.6.0 or later). Change your own dxvk.conf, rtx.conf and user.conf in the Garry's Mod folder
  instead: they win over the package's.
- RTX off, without uninstalling:  { "schema": 1, "allow": { "workshop": ["3829070317"] }, "remix": { "enabled": false } }
  This is how to play without RTX: the loader keeps the package's RTX-only add-ons out of the game
  and puts back the console settings RTX sessions changed.
- The loader off:                  add "enabled": false
- Nothing else in the file is needed. Native code comes only from what "allow" lists.
- -nonativeloader in the launch options (or the environment variable NATIVE_LOADER_DISABLE=1, or a
  file named native-loader\disable) skips the loader for that start, for troubleshooting. It is not
  a way to play without RTX: the loader then deploys, hides and puts back nothing. The package's
  add-ons stay in the game: its own Lua (the RTX Remix tab, the RTX fixes) does nothing in such a
  start, the other bundled add-ons run as ordinary add-ons, console settings an RTX session changed
  stay as they are, and a Workshop update waits for the next start with the loader. It uninstalls
  nothing.
- Loader 0.11.0 also reads these, all optional. An older loader rejects them and starts without
  RTX, so replace bin\win64\winmm.dll first.
  - "remix": { "performance_tier": "low" } picks the tier yourself: "high", "medium" or "low";
    "auto" (the default) lets the loader choose.
  - "diagnostics": { "gpu_crash_dumps": "next_start" } turns on NVIDIA's GPU crash diagnostics for
    the next RTX start, so a GPU crash leaves a dump in native-loader\logs\gpu; "always" turns them
    on at every start, "off" (the default) never. They cost some speed while they are on.
  - "diagnostics": { "memory_telemetry": "off" } stops the memory history the loader keeps in
    native-loader\logs\memory.csv (on by default; the last one to two hours; never uploaded).
  For example, the low tier:
  { "schema": 1, "allow": { "workshop": ["3829070317"] }, "remix": { "performance_tier": "low" } }
- Loader 0.13.0 also reads "remix": { "memory_profile": "minimum" }. It picks the memory profile
  yourself: "minimum", "recommended" or "high"; "auto" (the default) lets the loader choose. As
  above, an older loader rejects it.

Long loads
----------

- A big map, or hundreds of Workshop add-ons being mounted, can keep the game busy for minutes.
  Loader 0.12.1 stops Windows from greying out the window and adding "(Not Responding)" to its
  title meanwhile: the game is still working, and Remix and the menu keep drawing. A game that
  really froze no longer offers "Close the program"; end gmod.exe in Task Manager instead.
  Set NATIVE_LOADER_WINDOW_GHOSTING=1 to keep Windows' usual behaviour.

After a crash
-------------

- Loader 0.12.0 starts a separate observer from winmm.dll. After an abnormal game exit it shows
  one message with the known or likely reason, what to try, the exit code and the evidence folder,
  in your game language. Remix's own crash prompt finishes first. A normal quit shows nothing.
  The evidence folder also holds exit-report.json, and the next start shows the same conclusion.
  For unattended runs, set NATIVE_LOADER_EXIT_REPORT=quiet to keep the JSON report without a window.
  Set it to off only to skip the observer entirely. These switches never grant crash-dump consent.
- Loader 0.11.0 keeps what a session left behind before the next start overwrites it: Remix's
  log, the crash dumps already on your disk and the memory history, copied into
  native-loader\logs\sessions (the last five sessions, at most 200 MB). Nothing is uploaded, and the
  originals stay where they are. The home menu shows what probably went wrong last time and where
  the copies are.
- The in-game guide (console command nativeloader_guide) has a "Performance and memory" page: the
  performance tier and the memory profile, what to try with an 8 GB card or 16 GB of RAM, and what
  to send with a crash report.
- The runtime keeps unused static managed textures in CPU memory and creates their GPU images
  when first sampled, uploaded or explicitly preloaded. A large imported-model catalog therefore
  does not need GPU storage for every character before you use it. Texture detail, captured hashes
  and NPC/player-model registrations stay the same. The catalog can still use substantial RAM.
  The compatibility override is d3d9.deferManagedTextures = False in your game-root dxvk.conf.

RTX content from other Workshop items
-------------------------------------

- Subscribe to an RTX content package (Remix materials and mods, such as a character's PBR textures)
  and it loads at your next start, with loader 0.4.0 or later. No change to config.json is needed.
- Loader 0.14.0 takes such packages only from items you subscribed to. A server you join can make
  the game download Workshop items without a subscription; those are never deployed, and a content
  package an older loader deployed from one is removed at the next start. If Steam's list of your
  Workshop items cannot be read, nothing new is deployed and what is deployed stays.
- Such a package may only hold Remix mods and Lua add-ons. A package that also carries native code
  is skipped until you add its Workshop id to "workshop" under "allow".
- To use only what "allow" lists: add "subscribed_content": false under "allow".

ReShade
-------

- RTX Remix draws through Vulkan, so a ReShade installed for Direct3D 9 (bin\win64\d3d9.dll) has
  nothing to work on with RTX. It never loads into an RTX session, and the loader never changes
  its files: without RTX it works exactly as before.
- The RTX package brings ReShade 6.8.0 (by crosire, BSD 3-clause) for RTX sessions instead. If
  ReShade is set up for the game (bin\win64\ReShade.ini), the first RTX session copies its settings
  and presets into native-loader\reshade, and RTX sessions use those copies from then on. Your own
  ReShade.ini and presets stay as they are, so turning RTX off or removing the package needs no
  restoring.
- Home opens ReShade's overlay in an RTX session, as usual.
- ReShade costs some frame rate. Measured on an RTX 5090: nothing measurable at 1280 x 720; at
  3840 x 2160 a light effect cost about 0.9 ms a frame (7 %) and a heavy full-screen blur 2.8 ms.
  With "auto", the default, it is on only where ReShade is set up for the game. Setting
  "remix": { "reshade": "off" } in config.json turns it off; "on" turns it on for a game without a
  ReShade of its own.
- To take your Direct3D 9 settings over again, delete native-loader\reshade\ReShade.ini.

Updating
--------

- The RTX package updates through the Workshop. Steam downloads a new version, and the next start of
  Garry's Mod deploys it. An in-game message says when a restart is needed.
- A new loader: replace only bin\win64\winmm.dll. Keep your native-loader\config.json.
- The early rendering guard needs loader 0.10.0 or later. Updating the Workshop item alone does
  not replace an older installed winmm.dll.

Removing
--------

- Unsubscribe from the RTX Remix item: Steam deletes it when you next start the game from Steam, and
  the loader (0.3.1 or later) then removes the package and every file it deployed, and puts back
  your own files it had moved aside (0.6.0). Copies of package files you had changed stay in
  native-loader\backup\edits. Subscribing again brings it back.
- Delete bin\win64\winmm.dll: the next start is plain Garry's Mod again. Do it after the
  unsubscribed package is gone (one start later), so your own files are back first; otherwise
  they stay in native-loader\backup\originals.
- If bin\win64\winmm.dll is deleted before the package is gone, the files the loader deployed stay,
  and Garry's Mod would mount the package's add-ons without RTX. The RTX package removes them itself
  (2026-11 or later): start a single-player game once; the chat says RTX Remix was removed, then
  restart Garry's Mod. Its own files the game had open move to native-loader\backup\in-use, which
  you can delete. With an older package, put winmm.dll back, start the game once, then delete it.
